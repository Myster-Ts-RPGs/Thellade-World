## Notes

Malkor, the Corrupter of Souls, is a malevolent god who revels in the corruption of life and the perversion of death. He is often depicted as a large and skeletal figure, draped in tattered robes that seem to absorb the very light around them. His eyes burn with an unholy fire, and his voice is a rasping deep whisper that can chill the bones of the bravest mortals.

Malkor is the patron of necromancers and other practitioners of dark magic, who seek to control the dead and twist them to their will. He is also the god of corruption, tempting mortals with promises of power and wealth in exchange for their souls. Additionally, they have an aptitude to take the living and corrupt it into something dark, evil and twisted.

Those who worship Malkor are often outcasts, shunned by society for their embrace of the forbidden arts. They gather in secret covens, performing vile rituals and sacrifices to appease their dark lord. They believe that in death, their souls will be claimed by Malkor and elevated to a higher plane of existence, where they will continue to serve him for eternity.
