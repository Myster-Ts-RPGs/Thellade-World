## Notes

Ariah, the Spider Queen, is a cunning and manipulative goddess of trickery and deceit. She is often depicted as a beautiful woman with the lower body of a spider, and her followers believe that she weaves webs of lies and illusions to ensnare her enemies.

As the goddess of trickery and decite, Ariah is associated with subtlety and guile. Her followers believe that she can twist the truth and manipulate the perceptions of others, allowing her to achieve her goals without resorting to brute force. Ariah's power is often wielded by assassins, spies, and thieves who seek to gain an advantage over their enemies through cunning and deception.

Ariah is also the goddess of spiders, and her followers often revere these creatures as symbols of their faith. They believe that spiders embody the qualities of their goddess, weaving intricate webs to capture prey and striking swiftly and silently when the moment is right.

Those who seek Ariah's favor often make offerings of precious jewels or rare poisons, which they believe are pleasing to their goddess. Her priests and priestesses are often masters of disguise and illusion, using their powers to blend in with their surroundings and remain unnoticed by their enemies.
