## Notes

Gormmesh, the Crusader, is a fearsome and ruthless god of war and conquest. he is often depicted as a towering orc warrior adorned in blood-stained armor, wielding a massive battle axe. His followers are among the most fierce and brutal of warriors, and his name is often invoked in battle as a sign of strength and victory.

Gormmesh is a patron of the orcish race, and his followers often seek to conquer new lands and expand their territories in his name. He is revered by many orcs as a symbol of their strength and power, and his temples are often adorned with trophies of battle and the spoils of war.

As the god of war, Gormmesh is associated with death and destruction, and his followers often revel in the chaos and carnage of battle. His priests and priestesses are often skilled warriors themselves, and they lead their fellow orcs into battle with fervor and ferocity.

Those who seek his favor often make offerings at his shrines and spill blood in his name. His blessings are said to grant great strength and endurance in battle, and his curses are feared to bring defeat and death to those who cross his.
