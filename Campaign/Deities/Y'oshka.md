## Notes

Y'oshka, The Score Keeper, is the patron of hunters and warriors, who believe that she keeps track of their victories and defeats and will ultimately reward or punish them based on their deeds.

Y'oshka is said to have been born from the spirits of the hunt, created to keep track of the balance between predator and prey. She is depicted as a massive bear, standing on her hind legs and wielding a spear or bow in one hand, and a ledger or scroll in the other, symbolizing her role as the keeper of records.

Y'oshka is revered by those who believe in the thrill of the hunt and the rush of battle. Her followers believe that by offering her tribute and seeking her favour, they will be blessed with good luck and the skills to triumph in their pursuits.

The followers of Y'oshka hold great respect for her as the keeper of the balance between predator and prey, and they believe that by following her teachings and living a life of adventure, they will earn her favour and be rewarded in the afterlife.

However, those who cross Y'oshka and break the rules of the hunt, or who cheat in battle, face her wrath and the possibility of being struck from her ledger and forgotten forever.

Y'oshka's temples are often located on hunting grounds or near the site of great battles, and they often feature grand halls, trophy rooms, and arenas for followers to compete in and offer tribute to the Scorekeeper.

Her followers, who are often depicted as hunters, warriors, and gamblers, are known for their bravery, cunning, and adventurous spirit, and are respected by many throughout the world for their skills and devotion to their deity.
