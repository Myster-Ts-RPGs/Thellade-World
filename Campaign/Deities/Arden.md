## Notes

Arden is a powerful and ancient god, whose domain is the natural world. He is known as the caretaker of the forests, the mountains, and all other natural places on land. Arden is often depicted as a male figure whose face is one of a tree's. Their face looks old but kind, a beard made of twigs and leaves.

Arden is a kind and gentle god, who cares deeply for all living things. He is said to have infused his essence with the planet itself, which created the first forests and breathed life into the first animals. Arden is often worshipped by druids, rangers, and other nature-loving adventurers.

Arden's powers include control over the natural elements, the ability to heal and revive plants and animals, and the ability to shape the landscape. Above all else, Arden keeps the balance of nature. They are said to not intervene unless necessary, but it is said they have saved many lost or endangered animals.

Arden's followers are encouraged to live in harmony with the natural world and protect it from those seeking to exploit or destroy it. Many of his followers live in small, remote communities deep in the forests or mountains, living off the land and worshipping Arden in their own way.

Elves were created in Arden's vission.
