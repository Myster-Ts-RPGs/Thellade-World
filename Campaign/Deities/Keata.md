## Notes

Keata, the Goddess of the Arcane, is a revered deity among wizards, sorcerers, and anyone interested in the arcane arts. She is often depicted as a great owl with piercing eyes and outstretched wings, symbolizing her dominion over the mysteries of magic.

Keata was the one who gave birth to the practise and the existence of the arcane, allowing mere mortals to take the power and wonders of magic into their own hands. As the Goddess of the Arcane, Keata is responsible for overseeing the use and development of magical power in the world. She is both a teacher and a protector, guiding her followers in the safe and responsible use of magic, while also defending them from those who would misuse it.

Her temples are often great places of learning, schools of the arcane. Adorned with intricate magical sigils and contain vast libraries of arcane knowledge. Her priests and priestesses are renowned for their skill in spellcasting and are often sought out by those seeking to learn more about the arcane. They are typically separated from any major spellcaster group that entangles themselves in politics or much else outside of the learning of the arcane.

Keata's followers believe that the secrets of magic are infinite and that there is always more to be discovered. They are dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of magical understanding, all in the name of their beloved goddess.
