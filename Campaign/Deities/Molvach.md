## Notes

Molvach, Lord of the Nine Hells is the god of tyranny and domination. He is often depicted as a tall and imposing figure with dark red skin, large meancing horns and wings and a staff made of twisted black wood that crackles with dark energy.

Molvach's domain includes corruption, treachery, and subterfuge. He is known to twist the minds of mortals, turning them against one another and sowing chaos and discord wherever he goes. He is said to have the power to control shadows and to be able to create illusions that deceive even the most perceptive of eyes.

Those who worship Molvach do so out of fear rather than love, for he is a vengeful and cruel god who delights in the suffering of others. His followers often perform dark rituals to gain his favor, sacrificing innocent lives to feed his insatiable hunger for power.

Despite his malevolent nature, Molvach is a cunning and strategic deity who commands a legion of demonic minions. He is a master of manipulation and often plays both sides of a conflict to achieve his goals.
