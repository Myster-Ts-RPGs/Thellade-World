## Notes

Zephra, the Stormweaver, is a powerful and tempestuous goddess of the elements. She is often depicted as a fierce and beautiful woman with hair that crackles like lightning and eyes that flash like thunderbolts. She commands the winds and the seas, shaping storms and guiding ships through treacherous waters.

Zephra is both revered and feared by sailors and farmers alike, as her blessings and curses can make or break their livelihoods. She is said to be able to summon hurricanes and tempests at will or to calm the most violent of storms with a mere whisper.

As the goddess of weather, river and sea, Zephra is associated with both the destructive power of nature and its life-giving force. She is also known for her unpredictable and capricious nature, sometimes bestowing blessings upon her followers and other times causing destruction and chaos.

Those who seek her favour often make offerings at her shrines and perform rituals to appease her as well as show their might and resolve to gain her blessing. Her priests and priestesses are often sailors or farmers who rely on her protection and guidance to survive the harsh realities of life on the sea or on the land.
