## Notes

Koress is a powerful and imposing figure, a Platinum Dragon of immense size and strength. His scales are bright as a silvery moon, with glimmering hints of gold and his wings are a dark black with golden trim embroidered with intricately detailed patterns. He carries himself with a regal poise, his movements graceful yet powerful, every motion radiating authority and control.

Despite his fearsome appearance, Koress is known as the Dragon of Order for a reason. He embodies a sense of discipline and organization, and those who seek his favour often do so to bring order to their own lives or to establish control over their circumstances. He is highly intelligent, with a keen mind for strategy and planning, and his followers often look to him for guidance and wisdom.

Koress is not without his flaws, however. He love of order and structure can sometimes lead him to be overly rigid or inflexible, and he can come across as cold or uncaring to those who do not understand his motivations. He can also be fiercely protective of his followers and territory, and those who cross him or threaten his interests will quickly discover the full force of his wrath.

Despite these traits, Koress is revered and respected by many, both for his power and his unwavering dedication to the principles of order and discipline. He is often depicted in art and iconography as a powerful and regal figure, with a crown of gold atop his head and a sense of calm authority radiating from his every gesture.
