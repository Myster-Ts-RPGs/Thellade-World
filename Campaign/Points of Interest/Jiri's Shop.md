## Notes

Jiri Hollowpot's general shop, located in the town of Kamderah, is a cramped and cluttered little space located in the front living room of Jiri's home. Despite the limited space, Jiri has managed to cram in a variety of goods, ranging from household essentials to trinkets and toys. The shop is in a state of near-constant disarray, with stacks of goods piled haphazardly on shelves and boxes strewn about the floor. The shelves are lined with jars of spices, coils of rope, and other miscellaneous items. In the corner, a small table displays various trinkets and jewelry.

Jiri himself can often be found behind the counter, busily counting coins or restocking the shelves. Despite the chaotic appearance of his shop, Jiri is a cheerful and friendly halfling, always eager to chat with customers and offer his help. He has a keen eye for a good deal, and is always on the lookout for interesting items to add to his inventory. Despite the cramped conditions, Jiri's shop is a popular destination for those in need of a quick and inexpensive item, and he has built a loyal customer base over the years.
