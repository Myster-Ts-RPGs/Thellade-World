## The Founding
In the beginning, there was only chaos. The primordial planet was a wild, untamed world of fire, earth, water, and air, each element warring with the others for dominance. Some gods watched from beyond the void, observing this world with interest.

They saw the potential in this untamed world, the raw power that lay within each of the elements. At this time they had even this universe with no goal or purpose. However, this sparked something inside of them and gave them the motive to find their place through the creation of their own world. They decided to intervene, to bring order to the chaos and shape the world according to their will.

The gods descended from the heavens, each bringing their own unique gifts and abilities. They fought against the powerful elemental beings that ruled the planet, using their divine power to banish them and establish their own rule.

The first god to begin work was Brimdar. He brought with him the power of the forge and began to shape the earth, carving out mountains and valleys, rivers and seas.

Next came Arden and Zephyra, both begun work on taming the elements, filling in the vast oceans with water and land with green vegetation. Which in turn sprouted wildlife and beauty

Following them came Sil'jun, who breathed life into the world, filling it with all manner of life from wild to sentient. The first were the Humans, which were modelled after herself in appearance. But then swiftly followed the Dwarves, Elves and a vast variety of races.

These 4 gods are now known as the Founding Gods, those who found and shaped Aranor. Together, these four gods worked to create a world of order and balance. They created the first civilizations, each with its own unique cultures and traditions. They established the first religions, each dedicated to one of the four founding gods.

And so began the era of recorded time, a time of peace and prosperity, of order and balance, a time when the gods walked among mortals and shaped the world according to their will.

With life blossoming, the children of the gods lived short and violent lives. To this end, the gods saw fit to bestow upon them a small segment of their powers, resulting in divine magic.

It was at this time Koress and Molvach were drawn to this newly formed world, where they would find his place within the pantheon. With the help of Sil'jun, they spawned the magical begins known as dragons, who were to help bring order to the chaos and protect the weak as well as Tieflings.

Over the hundred of years later, Serendia, Veritas and Lysandra would all find their way one by one to Aranor, working with the pantheon established to help create and maintain their world and their children. Soon after the races of Halfling and Gnomes were born.

## The Rupture
After a thousand years, Aranor was at a time of peace and maintained a simple life. The god's children had expanded outside of the main settlements originally established and had taken their first steps in creating their own settlements.

It was at this time when spawns of the Elemental Plains came to reclaim their world, bringing with them great Elemental Titans to rival the gods themselves along with wiping out their children. The gods themselves did all they could to defend their children, but they were fighting a losing battle as people fled in fear and hid in the walls of the Founding Settlement walls.

It was then Keata, Y'oshka, Mallacross and Gormmesh arrived at Aranor. The chaos drew them to this world and all saw their part to play. Along with Sil'jun's help, they created the races of Orcs, Giants and Owlin. Orcs and Giants were large strong fighters who were the main bulk of the new fighting force for Aranor. Then the Owlin were imbued with the power of the Arcane. Allowing Owlin and many of the other races to harness the power to defend themselves.

Mallacross was drawn to the call of death and their calling was shown to them, they were to be the harbinger of the dead and guide lost souls to the afterlife.

With the newfound power and support, the people of Aranor claimed victory and repelled the attacking Elemental forces after years of conflict. Bring the world into a new age.

## Age of Erudition
After the destruction of so much, civilization dawned the first true city, 'Fjornholm.'

For centuries, the mortal races prospered during the golden age of Erudition. Allowing them to hone and perfect their magic. Perform great feats of engineering and learning what was beyond the material plane and looking into distant planes of existence.

During the age, Aranor had new visitors, Gods looking to join the pantheon of this world. Whilst not much is known about what happened between them, what is known, the new arrivals known as Ariah and Malkor were sent away by the prime deities.

The progression of knowledge and innovation from the mortals spawned great works but also led to unchecked arrogance among them.

One such mortal was on the verge of god-like power but could not quite reach it. So, it lead them down a dark route looking for gods outside of their pantheon, looking for powers they could harness. They made contact with Ariah and Malkor, the gods who were sent away. And with their help, the mortal achieved great power and ascended to godlike powers.

## Age of Armageddon
The mortal now God working alongside the castaway gods work in secret to overthrow the Prime Deities. It is not known if they corrupted the gods or if they just went mad, but Molvach and Gormmesh turned on the prime deities and their children to join them. And with their combined powers, spawned many horrors into Aranor, from goblinoids to monsters and beasts that they used as an army.

They even enlisted mortals as their own dark champions, either of their own free will or otherwise. using them as puppets for their own personal gains.

The fight for Aranor was a long drawn-out war that had all mortals, gods and champions working against one another to defeat the other side. It turned into a magical and engineering arms race, where mortals and deities alike worked to create engines of war.

During this time, the gods imbued fragments of their powers into items known as Fragments of Valiance, which were bestowed upon their champions.

Much history from this point and before is by far unknown or inconclusive, with many written records destroyed. However, the fractures and tears these battles left are visible to this day.

We know that the people of Aranor won, and the Malevolent deities were defeated. The city of 'Fjornholm' survived as it was the last stronghold of the people of Aranor.

During the final days of the war, the Prime Deities and their champions managed to banish the Malevolent gods away for the material plane, hoping they were gone for good.

## The Divergence
After the disaster of the Age of Armageddon, the Prime Deities did the only thing they could think of and created the Diving Gate. A shield for their creation that protects it from unchecked divinity, sealing all divine powers behind it.

The gods sacrificed their ability to return to the material plane, their creation and their children. But Aranor would now be protected from all powers from outside, leaving them to protect themselves. Their powers are now being channelled only by their most devoted worshipers.

Armageddon shook Aranor and almost destroyed it, but from it, new settlements and cultures spawned and cultivated.
