## Current Events



## History

Kielash was raised by her mother, [[Phelia Malgil]], a revered and skilled huntress. From an early age, Kielash admired her mother's strength, skill, and dedication to protecting their community from dangerous beasts and threats.

Tragically, Kielash's mother passed away four years ago due to health problems, leaving a void in her heart. Determined to honor her mother's memory, Kielash has taken it upon herself to continue the legacy of the Malgil family as a huntress.

However, as a young and naive dragonborn, Kielash still has much to learn. She is eager to prove herself and become a capable huntress, but her lack of experience sometimes leads her into challenging and perilous situations. Nevertheless, Kielash's determination and eagerness to learn drive her to persevere, seeking mentors and opportunities to refine her skills and broaden her knowledge of the wild.

Kielash's journey is one of growth and self-discovery, as she navigates the dangers of the wilderness and seeks to establish her own identity as a huntress. She yearns to become a figure of strength and inspiration, just like her beloved mother.
