## Current Events



## History

Thorgrim Ironbeard was once a renowned warrior. He and his wife, [[Greta Ironbeard]], lived a peaceful life until the rebellion struck their home. During the chaos of the conflict, Greta tragically lost her life along with their unborn child. The loss of his family shattered Thorgrim, leaving him consumed by grief and a burning desire for vengeance.

In his younger days, Thorgrim fought valiantly in conflicts against threats to the kingdom. He had earned a reputation for his skill with the axe and his unwavering loyalty. However, the loss of his wife and unborn child changed him profoundly. He retired from active duty, no longer finding solace in the defense of his people.

Driven by his pain, Thorgrim has spent years meticulously gathering information about the rebellion and those who led it. He seeks to uncover those who killed his wife and get revenge. Thorgrim has become a relentless investigator and a force to be reckoned with, channelling his grief and anger into a focused determination to avenge his family.

## Notes

Thorgrim carries a small, intricately crafted pendant containing a lock of his wife's hair, which he clutches tightly during moments of deep reflection or when overwhelmed by grief.
