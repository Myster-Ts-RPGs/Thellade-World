## History

Apagak Nola-Kileana was born into the [[Dyull Clan]], a Goliath tribe known for their connection to the rugged mountains of the Fulcrum Ridge. From a young age, Apagak exhibited leadership qualities and a strong connection to the ancestral spirits of his clan. His dedication to the welfare of the [[Dyull Clan]] earned him respect and admiration from his peers.

Over the years, Apagak honed his leadership skills and deepened his understanding of goliath traditions and customs. He earned his place as the Chief of the Dyull Clan after a great hunt to track down a pack of Wargs that hunted his people for sport and for food. After proving himself, killing the pack leader on 1 on 1 combat. He challenged and killed his father, becoming the new chief.

As Chief, Apagak has led the Dyull Clan through various challenges, defending their territory from external threats. He is a revered figure within the clan, serving as a role model for younger goliaths and a source of guidance and wisdom.

Apagak takes great pride in his son, Naveith Nola-Kileana, and the potential he sees in him. He has provided Naveith with the best training and guidance, preparing him to eventually take on important responsibilities within the clan. Apagak's love for his son is matched only by his dedication to the Dyull Clan.
