## Description

Time is the most unyielding force in existence. It grinds down mountains, buries empires, and silences gods. Those who attempt to bend it with magic or machines often find themselves face-to-face with what emerges from the cracks they leave behind.

**Xar'Kairos** is such a horror—an acausal aberration that exists outside of the normal flow of cause and effect. It does not come when summoned, it arrives when **reality has been violated**. Its presence is a consequence, not a decision.

Its visible form is partially phase-locked—a massive, worm-like shape lined with spiraling voids and thirteen radial limbs that spin like spokes around a central collar. Its face is a nightmare of mirrored flesh and warping identity. Wherever it moves, the environment destabilizes, memories shift, and time stutters.

> “It doesn’t *happen* like we do. It won’t care if you kill it—it’ll just deal with dying later. Hell, it probably tucks the moment away for when it wants a nap.”  
> — Elsza DuMeranna, Sage Knight of Tonbaria

## Encounter Design

**Xar'Kairos** appears only under rare, catastrophic circumstances:
- Major time-travel or timeline rewriting
- Failed planar fusions
- Divine or magical paradoxes
- The unraveling of sealed narrative constructs

It should never be a routine enemy. It is a **cosmic glitch**, a reaper of timelines, a paradox made flesh.

### Moments Marked  
Xar'Kairos tracks enemy positions and can attack “echoes” from those spots.

### Inverted Timeflow  
At turn start: heals 1d6+3 HP or halves all active durations. Can Disengage as bonus action.

---

**Past-Ripper:** +10 to hit, 10 ft reach  
2d6+5 slashing + 1d6 psychic or thunder + bonus damage for marked space

**Future-Breaker:** +10 to hit, sets 2 zones  
3d8+5 bludgeoning + 1d6 psychic or thunder; damages first creature to enter

**Tesseract (Recharge 4–6):**  
INT Save or 4d8 force (half on save). If in center cube, also DEX Save or 2d8 + 1d6 turns displaced in time.

---

### Reactions

**Temporal Deflection:** Redirects attack to marked target with DEX save. On failure, heals 5 HP.

**Convergence:** If creature ends turn on mark, CON Save or take 1d4+8 force, -2 AC, -10 ft speed.

### Timeline Flux (Start of Each Turn – Roll d12)

| d12 | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Xar'Kairos takes 3d8+6 damage as temporal wounds rupture; all other creatures heal 1d6+6 HP. |
| 2 | All creatures are moved 10 ft in a random direction and find themselves in a slightly different location than they remember; initiative is not changed, but memories are jumbled (confusion-like effect for 1 round). |
| 3 | Initiative order is completely reshuffled; Xar'Kairos rerolls initiative with advantage. |
| 4 | A copy of a random creature (hostile or friendly) is teleported adjacent to Xar'Kairos. The original disappears until the end of its next turn. Both share HP during the overlap. |
| 5 | Xar'Kairos heals 2d8+6 HP as its injuries rewind into nonexistence. |
| 6 | Each spellcaster loses one random spell slot. For each spell slot lost this way, Xar'Kairos takes 3 force damage, as temporal backlash manifests in spell echoes. |
| 7 | All creatures immediately use one Hit Die to regain HP. Xar'Kairos rolls a d10 instead. |
| 8 | Xar'Kairos gains +1 AC until the end of its next turn, appearing partially out-of-phase and blurred across multiple moments. |
| 9 | Xar'Kairos may take one additional action immediately. |
| 10 | The last change made to Xar'Kairos's HP is undone. If it was damaged last, that damage is healed. If healed, the healing is reversed. |
| 11 | All other creatures take 2d8+4 slashing damage as they gain retroactive memories of being attacked. Physical wounds manifest to match. |
| 12 | Xar'Kairos gains advantage on all attack rolls until the start of its next turn, acting in multiple parallel presents.

### Acausal

Xar'Kairos exists outside the flow of conventional time. It is immune to all time-based magic, chronomantic effects, or temporal displacement (such as *time stop*, *haste*, *slow*, or *temporal stasis*).

When Xar'Kairos is reduced to 0 HP, it remains active for 1d6–1 additional rounds. At the beginning of each of these rounds, it returns with a random percentage (25%/50%/75%/100%) of its maximum HP (roll a d4). If it heals **40 or more HP** during this extension, it stabilizes at **40 HP** and continues normally.

This effect cannot activate more than once per day. While in this state, all healing received is tracked separately. If reduced to 0 HP again, it is permanently destroyed as normal.

During its Acausal phase:
- Attack rolls against Xar'Kairos have a 25% chance to *retroactively fail* (GM discretion).
- Actions taken against it may appear to succeed but are undone narratively at the end of the round.


### Additional Trait:  
**Worm-Scream** – All attacks deal +2d6 psychic or thunder damage

---

### Actions

**Tesseract (Recharge 4–6):**  
6d8 force. Center cube causes 2d8 + displace 1d6 rounds forward in time. Adjust HP by 1d12–7 per round delayed.

**Time Loop (1/day):**  
For 1d6×2 rounds, players must repeat their prior turn or take 7d6 necrotic. If they repeat, gain +1 on any roll. Xar'Kairos heals 10/turn. Ends: Xar'Kairos is stunned 1 round.

---

### Legendary Actions (3/round)

- **Past-Ripper**
- **Future-Breaker**
- **Tesseract (2 actions)**
- **Wormhole (2 actions)** – Redirect movement between 4 designated spaces. If player ends turn in the zone: 2d6 force, disadvantage on saves.
- **Sever Timeline (3 actions, 1/day):** Makes 6 narrative predictions. If 3+ come true, party suffers 20 psychic + 20 force, disadvantage until next turn. Else: Xar'Kairos heals 12 per correct prediction.
