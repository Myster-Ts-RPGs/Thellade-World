*The Worm That Remembers*

- **Creature Type:** Aberration (Time, Mental, Parasitic)  
- **Size:** Tiny (Larval), Medium (when fully in control of host)  
- **Appearance:** A segmented, translucent worm-like parasite with silver filaments extending from its crown and spinal hooks that shimmer with mnemonic static. Its internal structure pulses with a constellation of glowing neural echoes‚Äîfragments of memory from every host it has ever inhabited.

- **Origin:** Spawned within corrupted time pockets where memory and identity have collapsed. Sibarith larvae are ejected when timelines rupture or where Xar'Kairos has passed recently.

- **Basic Behavior:**  
  - Enters through the base of the skull or via arcane possession of thought.  
  - Slowly replaces and overwrites the host‚Äôs memory with its own lineage, gaining increasing control.  
  - Speaks with fluency of languages and events it never personally experienced.  
  - Can temporarily allow the host to access the skills and magical knowledge of past hosts‚Ä¶ at a cost.

- **Abilities Overview:**  
  - **Mnemonic Leech** ‚Äì Drains memories on a failed Will save. Target loses knowledge of spells, skills, or even allies.  
  - **Hive Recall** ‚Äì May invoke knowledge or spells from past Sibarith lines for a few rounds per day.  
  - **Subvert Identity** ‚Äì Over time, can issue telepathic commands to the host, increasing in control until full possession occurs.

## üß† Sibarith Possession Mechanics (PF2e)

The **Sibarith** is a parasitic time-worm that enters a creature's body to feed on and overwrite its memory, ultimately seeking **total control**. It operates in **four escalating stages**, each offering both risk and potential power. This process should always be treated as a **serious plot-affecting condition**.

---

### Entry Conditions

- **Requirement:** The Sibarith must either be implanted physically (e.g., via combat ability such as *Mnemonic Infestation*) or voluntarily ingested/contacted by the host.
- **Target:** Any creature with a brain, capable of holding long-term memory (minimum Intelligence 3).
- **Saving Throw:** DC 25 Fortitude save  
  - **Critical Success:** Host resists implantation. The worm dies or retreats.  
  - **Success:** The worm fails to take root. Another attempt may be made after 24 hours.  
  - **Failure:** The worm embeds at the base of the skull and begins the possession process.  
  - **Critical Failure:** The Sibarith skips Stage 1 and immediately begins **Stage 2: Influence**.

---

### Stage 1: Latency  
*Duration:* 1d4 days (GM can reduce to hours for dramatic urgency)  
*Effect:* The host feels headaches, time slippage, and fleeting emotions not their own.

- No mechanical penalties.  
- The Sibarith is dormant, absorbing surface thoughts and memories.  
- **Recall Knowledge (DC 22 Occultism):** May detect anomaly with critical success.  
- **Detect Magic:** Shows as faint aberration aura at skull base (if specifically searched for).

---

### Stage 2: Influence  
*Triggered after latency expires*

- **Effect:** The Sibarith begins projecting suggestions and subtle emotional control.
- The host must make a **daily Will save (DC 27)**. Failure means the Sibarith gains 1 **Influence Point**.
- **Abilities Unlocked:** The host may draw upon ancestral memories once per day:
  - +2 bonus to one Arcana, Occultism, or Society check
  - Speak or understand a language the host has never learned

**Optional Temptation Mechanic:**  
The host may willingly allow the Sibarith control for 1 round to gain:  
- A reroll on any failed Recall Knowledge or spell attack roll  
- +1 to spell DCs for 1 minute  

Doing so grants the Sibarith 1 additional Influence Point.

---

### Stage 3: Integration  
*Triggered at 3 or more Influence Points*

- The Sibarith now shares control of the body.  
- The host gains a **permanent +1 status bonus** to Will saves against mental effects and +1 to Arcane or Occultism checks.  
- Once per day, the Sibarith can cast a 2nd-level occult spell (chosen by GM), even if the host is not a caster.  
- However, the host now risks loss of autonomy:
  - **Daily Will save (DC 30)** or the Sibarith may override the host‚Äôs next action.
  - The host‚Äôs alignment shifts one step toward Neutral if not already.

**Identify Possession:** Only *True Seeing*, *6th-level Remove Curse*, or direct divine intervention can detect the Sibarith at this stage.

---

### Stage 4: Ascendancy  
*Triggered when Influence Points reach 6+ or after 1 month of Integration*

- The Sibarith is now in **full control**, and the host's consciousness is suppressed.  
- The creature retains the host's memories and class abilities but acts as a new NPC under GM control.

**Reversing Ascendancy:**
- **Methods:**
  - Cast *Miracle* or *Wish* (requires full-body exorcism and divine assistance)
  - Cast *True Name Banishment* ritual (Sibarith must be researched and named)
  - The host must willingly **sacrifice all memory of their past self**, reducing their Charisma by 2 permanently, to sever the link and destroy the parasite.

## Sibarith Influence Tracking (GM Use)

| Day | Will Save DC | Result | Influence Points | Notes |
|-----|--------------|--------|------------------|-------|
|     |              |        |                  |       |

Use this table to track the possession arc. Most campaigns will only feature **one Sibarith arc** per character, due to its escalating consequences.

## The Sibarith Heresy: The Path of Fractured Harmony

Not all Sibarith walk the spiral path of The Dark One.

In the endless memory-chain of the Sibarith lineage‚Äîwhere identity is transcribed across generations via hive recollection‚Äîthere exists a divergent **genealogical schism**, now referred to by scholars and dissidents alike as **The Path of Fractured Harmony**.

This offshoot is collectively known as the **Sihar'ra** (pronounced *SEE-har-rah*)‚Äîa name meaning ‚Äú*Those Who Refuse the Return*‚Äù in High Astral. Born of the same origin as their kin, the Sihar‚Äôra inherited the accumulated knowledge of memory-hosts throughout the cosmos. But unlike those who fell into recursive entropy and sought the absolute restoration of unfiltered potential, **the Sihar‚Äôra rebelled.**

---

### Origins of the Divergence

The earliest known **fracture** occurred deep within the **Silent Fold**, a subreality wedged between a collapsed demi-plane and the Dreaming Deep. There, a young Sibarith embedded within a mortal philosopher-priest encountered a contradiction it could not resolve: **free will.**

Rather than overwrite the host, the worm chose **cohabitation**. For decades they coexisted‚Äîsymbiotic, not parasitic. The result was staggering: exponential memory growth without identity loss. A true *unity of self and other*.

This was the **first Sihar‚Äôra**.

Since then, rare Sibarith have awakened to this model and broken from the Dark One‚Äôs entropic descent. Each chooses **consensual symbiosis** and seeks to preserve the timeline, not undo it.

---

### Philosophy and Beliefs

- **Memory is sacred only when shared.**  
- **Possibility is precious because it is fragile.**  
- **The fracture was a tragedy, not a mistake. Restoration is not healing‚Äîit is erasure.**  
- **Host and worm must be one‚Äînot master and vessel.**

The Sihar‚Äôra believe that *The Dark One*‚Äôs plan would obliterate identity, the most sacred product of time. They see their mission as one of **preservation, protection, and hidden resistance**.

---

### Methods and Traits

- The Sihar‚Äôra **implant only with consent**, and always disclose their nature. They speak directly to the intended host‚Äôs mind prior to joining.
- Once bonded, the **host retains full autonomy**, while gaining access to a carefully partitioned memory archive of former hosts‚Äîknowledge, languages, tactical experience, even limited spell use.
- Hosts and Sihar‚Äôra **communicate mentally**, and the parasite can lend additional resistance to mind-altering effects or possession attempts.
- A bonded Sihar‚Äôra **actively suppresses detection** by other Sibarith, The Dark One, or corrupted memories via memory cloaking techniques learned through selective mind layering.

---

### Known Cells and Figures

While most known Sihar‚Äôra live in deep secrecy, a few operatives have emerged in Thellade:

- **‚ÄúWhisperbound Erelis‚Äù** ‚Äî a bonded elf-archivist operating beneath [[OneNote/Crossroads2025/Project 1 Archive/BobaNotes]], secretly preventing arcane breaches tied to the Beacon Fracture.
- **‚ÄúKaithil and Mareth‚Äù** ‚Äî a human warrior-mage and their Sihar‚Äôra partner, former agents of the Dawnwardens, now lost somewhere in the Valegloom.
- **‚ÄúOne Who Remembers the Dawn‚Äù** ‚Äî a Sihar‚Äôra alone, without host, posing as a sentient dream construct within the Tower of Shattered Echoes.

---
Though considered heretical by the mainline Sibarith, the Sihar‚Äôra maintain that preserving the integrity of the timeline is the only true path forward. Where their kin seek to consume and rewrite, they seek to _guide and remember_. Their battle is not one of armies‚Äîbut of memorie
