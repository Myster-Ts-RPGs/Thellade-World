*Harbinger of Forgotten Tomorrows*

- **Creature Type:** Aberration (Time, Entropic, Radiant)  
- **Size:** Large  
- **Appearance:** A towering, robed figure of sheer white light and rotted time-energy, with a head that constantly splits and reforms from shattered clock faces. Its hands are inscribed with symbols no longer spoken, and it carries a staff that rings with the sound of ages collapsing.

- **Origin:** Once a divine servant of a forgotten deity of fate, the Null Shepherd was consumed during the Time Wars and now serves only entropy. It appears where future events are destined to be erased—like a shepherd preparing the field for oblivion.

- **Basic Behavior:**  
  - It does not kill. It unthreads.  
  - Walks through the present with steps that ripple backward and forward.  
  - Appears moments before disasters and removes any memory of its passage.  
  - Often seen in dreams moments before timeline collapses.

- **Abilities Overview:**  
  - **Null Pulse** – Emits a wave of entropy. All creatures within range must save or forget the last hour.  
  - **Fated Silence** – Cancels one ability, action, or spell before it occurs as if it never was.  
  - **Erase From Time** – On a critical hit, a creature becomes unrecognizable to allies—treating them as if they never existed for 1 minute.
