> [!recite]- Introduction
> Herald Elandor appears as a radiant, translucent figure‚Äîa woman in her late 40s clad in ceremonial robes of flowing sunsteel thread and lunar-woven silk. Her features are etched with wisdom and sorrow, and a luminous corona of braided hair crowns her brow like sunbeams in eclipse. Auric chains hang loosely at her wrists, symbolic of her vow to remain in vigil until the final light fails.
>
>Her form flickers slightly as if viewed through sunrise mist. When she speaks, her voice resonates with layered harmonics‚Äîlike multiple versions of herself echoing in harmony, stretched across time.

## Overview

> [!summary]- Overview  
> **Role**: Echo-bound Herald, keeper of the Dawn-Marked Seal

**Disposition**:  
Serene but intense. Elandor is driven by duty and reverence. Her words are measured, and she speaks as one who has endured centuries of solitude and silence. She does not see herself as fully alive, nor fully dead‚Äîshe is ‚Äúheld in oath,‚Äù preserved by the unfinished will of Aurion.

### üîÜ Background

Herald Elandor was once the High Dawnkeeper of the Aurionic Sanctum beneath Lambaro‚Äîchosen not for power, but for clarity of spirit. During the final days of the Binding War, she remained in the sanctum as it was sealed mid-rite, time folding over the location like a golden shroud. The ritual that would reinforce the southern beacon was never completed. She never left.

To this day, she stands at the still point of the sanctum‚Äôs time fracture, tethered by Aurion‚Äôs divine command. Though her body is long dead, her echo persists‚Äîneither ghost nor memory, but an oath-anchored guardian.

She knows the sanctum is breaking. She has watched for signs of renewal or corruption. When the party arrives, she will recognize them as both potential saviors and unintended heirs to a fading divine trust.

### üß† Personality Traits

- **Ideals**: Duty above desire; time is sacred; oaths once spoken must echo forever
    
- **Flaws**: Cannot act outside ordained purpose unless directly released
    
- **Fears**: That her watch was in vain; that Aurion has gone silent
    
- **Mannerisms**: Tilts her head when listening to timelines others cannot hear. Frequently quotes incomplete prophecies. Moves like she‚Äôs still surrounded by acolytes who aren‚Äôt there.
    
- **Goals**: To pass on the Dawn-Marked Seal, finish the ritual that began centuries ago, and ensure the temple‚Äôs collapse is not in vain.

### üß† She Knows:

- The _names_ of the prior timebound keepers (may serve as passphrases).
    
- That the 4th beacon seal was never completed.
    
- That the rising chaos is a reflection of weakened bindings.
    
- That one among the party is ‚Äúout of time‚Äù in ways even she cannot see clearly.
    
- The Ritual of Final Dawn can only be completed if light and darkness speak as one.

> ‚ÄúYou bear the weight of an hour I have not yet seen. But I know your hands‚ÄîI've seen them in firelight. You are meant to be here.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúI am bound, not by chains‚Äîbut by the final breath of a god who asked me to wait.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúThere were once four lights in this chamber. One failed. One was unfinished. One is you.‚Äù
