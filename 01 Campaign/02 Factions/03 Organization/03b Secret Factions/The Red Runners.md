## Overview

### Description
> The [[01 Campaign/02 Factions/03 Organization/03b Secret Factions/The Red Runners|Red Runners]] originated in [[Jambito]] as a collection of freelance thieves, assassins, and smugglers, but have evolved into a sprawling, militarized syndicate. Their operations encompass illicit trade, political blackmail, and cult collaboration, with a focus on destabilizing legitimate governance while strengthening infernal and abyssal footholds across the [[01 Campaign/01 World/03 Regions/01 Thellade/The Outcast Isles|Outcast Isles]]. They mask their movements through black-market networks and corrupted noble houses, thriving in shadows cast by both mortal law and divine neglect.

### Oaths
> "Blood spills in silence. Secrets are sold in whispers. The dagger precedes the crown."

### Mission Statement
> To control commerce, secrets, and influence across the Isles by any means necessary, advancing infernal or abyssal supremacy when it strengthens their position.

### Laws
> - Never betray the Syndicate without permission of the [[01 Campaign/02 Factions/03 Organization/03e Other Organizations/The Council of Daggers]].
> - Protect trade routes and smuggling operations at all costs.
> - Execute traitors and informants without public exposure.
> - Respect contracts made with allied factions unless rescinded by [[01 Campaign/03 Entities/04 NPCs/The Outcast Isles/Jambito/Jambito/Kaelos Vark|Kaelos 'The Blooded Blade' Vark]] himself.

### Tenets
> - Profit in all endeavors.
> - Secrecy above loyalty; loyalty above mercy.
> - Cultivate corruption; never cure it.
> - Strengthen alliances with infernal patrons.

### Prohibitions
> - Revealing syndicate operations to city guards or nobles without authorization.
> - Unauthorized assassination of high-profile targets.
> - Conspiring independently with rival factions like  [[the Eternal Concord]] or [[the Arcane Wardens]].
> - Refusing a direct order from a Council member.

##  Locations
### Primary Hideouts
  - Warehouse Undercrypts (Jambito Docks)
  - The Ember Vein Tavern (Dockside Meeting Point)
  - The Walled Den (Ruined Headquarters, Jambito Undercity)
  - The Gilded Hook (Exclusive Smuggling Den for Nobles)
### Secondary Hideouts
  - Lambaro Safehouse (Hidden under Daggerâ€™s Hollow Tavern)
  - Mangagoy Sea Caves (Braganâ€™s Smuggling Lanes)
  - Mwingu Apothecary Front (Zhen Ashun's "clinic")
  - Middle Islands: Sunken Temple Base (Shadara's Necromantic Coven)

## Notes
- **Threat Level:** Extreme. Red Runners have infiltrated city watches, merchant houses, and minor noble courts.
- **Speculative Rift:** Some Red Runner members suspect Kaelos Varkâ€™s secret allegiance to Asmodean cults could doom the faction.
- **Faction Allies:** Partial alliances with the Infernal Covenant (Asmodeus) and secret trading ties with the Silver Chain.
- **Faction Enemies:** The Emberborn League, Eternal Concord, Arcane Wardens (suspected investigations).
- **Symbol:** A stylized red serpent entwined around a black dagger with a flaming background and the "RR" bullhorned motif embedded behind it.
- **Uniforms:** Standard members wear dark crimson sashes or neckbands. Senior enforcers have leather jackets branded with a double-R symbol stitched over the heart. Ritualists and infernal agents bear black-and-scarlet cloaks marked with infernal glyphs.

### Key Plot Threads
- **Infernal Contracts:** Red Runners have smuggled and guarded infernal relics intended for cult rituals.
- **Political Manipulation:** Coordinating false flag attacks between merchant factions to destabilize Boba and Jambito.
- **Cult Collaboration:** While not all Red Runners are cultists, the leadership barters power with both Asmodean and Orcus-worshipping splinters.
- **Expansion Goals:** Moving beyond Jambito into Lambaro, Mwingu, Mangagoy, and the Middle Islands through espionage, assassination, and necromantic control.

### Artifacts and Evidence Found
- Infernal ledgers linking them to [[Lord Marcellus Veyne]].
- Teleportation circles used for infernal summoning.
- Ritual daggers, infernal tomes, and coded assassination contracts.
- Blackmail records involving Jambito nobles.
