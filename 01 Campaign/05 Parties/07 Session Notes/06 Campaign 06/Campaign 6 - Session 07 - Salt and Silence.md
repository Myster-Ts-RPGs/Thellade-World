# Campaign 6 Session 7 - Salt and Silence

## Date
**Game Time:** 04–05 Dawnmarch, 212 PR  
**Real Date Played:** April 20, 2025  

## Summary
The party continues their voyage aboard the *Emberwake*, rescuing Sister Malira Fen from a lifeboat adrift in the Sundering Deep. Her cryptic memories reveal that one of the mouths of Xal’Zul has already broken free beneath eastern Lambaro, and the relics aboard the ship are resonating with fragments of the Second Verse. Working together, the party destroys the final remaining relic using divine fire and coordinated ritual action.

Later, under the cover of night, the party infiltrates Captain Greaves’ quarters in a five-phase skill challenge, uncovering damning evidence: a sigil-sealed note from “TG,” a blood-oil-soaked rose, and a consignment order to Boba under the alias “S. Chapel.” On Day 5, a Salted Ghost Pirate Captain leads a supernatural attack on the *Emberwake*, targeting Sister Malira. The ship is defended successfully, but not before chilling warnings are spoken and strange dreams follow.

## Detailed Notes

### 🚢 Recovery of Sister Malira Fen
- Found in a drifting lifeboat near eastern Lambaro cliffs.
- Rambling and semi-conscious, she warned of the First Verse escaping from a failed seal.
- Revealed that Brother Falen, guardian of the seal, was devoured or unmade.
- Shared memory of the seal’s collapse and the rise of the Verse in vivid metaphoric terms.
- Identified the remaining artifact (Unseen Choir Effigy) as resonant with the verse’s echo.

### 🔥 Destruction of Cult Relic
- Conducted 5-check group skill challenge to destroy the Mirror Effigy:
  - Religion, Occultism, Arcana/Crafting, Performance/Deception required.
  - Participants: Spike, Kibo, Boud, Varis, Euril.
  - Final divine flame blow delivered by Dame Alenwyn Duskforge.
- Mirror collapsed into a void and vanished.
- Psychic relief was immediate; verse no longer echoed.

### 🧪 Destruction of Consecrated Vial
- Silvery-red liquid imbued with necromantic and illusion aura.
- Spirit fire used by Spike to incinerate contents, turning it into sanctified ash.
- Malira confirmed it was “one of the listening relics.”

## 🌑 Creeping Dreams After the Battle
All party members (and some allies) suffer disturbing prophetic dreams:

- **Kibo**: Reflection chanting “I will carry the verse…”
- **Spike**: Shattered cyst sings in a child’s voice.
- **Varis**: Pulled into blackness by his reflection saying “She cannot escape again.”
- **Boud**: Wheel of mouths; whispers “You will forget your name.”
- **Garrik**: Walks the ocean floor; mouth sealed, voice stolen.

## 🕯️ Next Steps
- Reach Kanda in approx. 1.5 days.
- Decide whether to inform local authorities, temples, or the king.
- Discuss how to track “Greyash” and stop further relic shipments.
