## 🌅 Day 1 (Dawn 03–04)

- The voyage begins with calm waters and clear skies.
- Players coordinate night watches: Spike and Boud on first, followed by others.
- **Spike** encounters **Tix** burning a humming driftwood **tuning fork**. Spike tries to secretly retrieve it with telekinetic hand, but fails.
  - The fork radiated planar resonance—a component for extraplanar rituals.
- **Garrik** discovers a crate marked with the sigil of the **Black Sepulcher**, a cult loyal to **Orcus**.

---

## 📦 Nighttime Investigation

**Kibo** investigates the marked crate:
- Successfully uncovers:
  - A **Scroll of Warding Dissolution** – specialized *Dispel Magic* to break divine bindings (bonus to counteract, backlash on fail)
  - The **Second Verse** of the Choir (burned later)
  - Multiple cursed relics, scrolls, glyph-stones, and effigies linked to **Xal’Zul**, one of Orcus’s lieutenants

> 📜 **Second Verse (Burned):**  
> “When the voice is stilled, the chain may break—  
> The breath unsung shall birth the ache.  
> Let the root uncoil, the mouth unfold—  
> For memory dies when the song is told...”  
> *(Revealed connection to relic activation)*

---

## 🎼 Artifact Analysis

Multiple magical relics were identified:

- **Bone-Cord Prayer Rosary** – +1 to divine counteract, daily use
- **Statuette of the Worm Choir** – memory-erasure idol, breaks divine protections
- **Unseen Choir Effigy** – ritual focus, causes haunting and worm-visions
- **Hollow Icon of the Maw** – intimidation bonus, causes disturbing dreams
- **Choir Supplicant Statue** – concealed mouthless figure, source unknown
- **Null-Glyph Stones (x3)** – desecrate effect, defiles divine sanctums
- **Mirror Fragment** – matched mural seen near Deep Dark ruins

**Note:** Relics were made using **ashes of Dawnbringers of Lunara** and **abyssal oil.**

---

## 🧠 The Cyst of Resonance

- Discovered at the bottom of the crate: a **psionic relic** pulsing with silver glyphs
- **Spike** identified it as a **Sleeper Artifact** storing **Xal’Zul’s Third Verse**

> 🧬 **Third Verse (Triggered by identification):**  
> “We sang of void before the dawn, where time is teeth and stars are gone...  
> From coil to hymn, from word to flesh, the Choir feeds where thought is fresh...  
> One mouth to echo, one to bind, and one to eat the waking mind.”

🧠 **Properties of the Cyst:**
- Not castable—**a psionic trap**
- Reactivates **ritual resonance** when placed near divine sites or leyline nodes
- Bypasses immunity to mental effects (affects undead/constructs)
- Likely triggered by passage over **leyline convergence**, explaining compass disruption

---

## ⚠️ Psychic Backlash

- Two of the Choir statues were destroyed:
  - Caused lingering psychic stains
  - Casters who try to recover spells within 24 hours must make saves or become *Stupefied 1*

- The **Second Verse** was burned to prevent unintentional activation.

---

## 🧭 Compass Failure

- On Day 2 (Dawn 04), the *Emberwake*’s compass began spinning erratically.
- **Spike’s analysis** confirmed convergence of **leylines**—the cyst resonated violently.
- **Zakka’s warning** matched:  
  > “The song forgets its name... The sky coiled like bone…”

---

## 🗣️ Zakka's Chant (Mouth-bound Echo)

> “When the world was wounded, the silence stood—  
> Three voices called from stone and wood.  
> With name unspoken, with truth unknown, we sang the cage of thought alone.  
> By light of dawn, by waning star, we sealed the mouth with sacred scar.  
> Let memories sleep where the earth forgets—  
> Where the song begins, the sun resets.”

**Touching Zakka during this chant gave Boud a vision:**
- A warped **Lunaran sanctum**, altar coiled in worm-like spirals
- The vision ended with an ominous whisper:  
  > *“You carry fire… you carry seals… but not the name.  
  He who speaks the final verse will open the hymn’s throat.”*

---

## 🧾 Hidden Orders Found

- Hidden in the crate: a coded **Black Sepulcher courier manifest**
  - Mentions **Tobias Greyash** in **Kanda’s Chapel Quarter**
  - Orders: “Burn after the second moon wanes” (Dawn 09)
  - Confirms **cult contact in Kanda**, not Boba as originally suspected

---

## ⚖️ Final Actions

- The party destroyed most relics using Divine Lance and psionic force
- They retained:
  - The Cyst of Resonance
  - One Null Glyph Stone
  - One statue
  - The Scroll of Warding Dissolution
- A mocking note from Spike ("Kiss my dragon ass") was left in the false bottom

---

## 🎭 Final Scene

> As night falls on Day 2, a black-sailed vessel appears on the horizon, trailing buoys.  
> Before action can be taken, the party spots a **lifeboat**, half-sunk, adrift in the moonlight.  
> Inside lies a **pale woman**, soaked and bound in prayer beads.  
> Her lips part, and without sound, a message enters their minds:

> “The song forgets its name… and so shall you.”

📌 **Session Ends.**



## 🧭 Session Summary

The session opened with the party finalizing preparations and boarding the *Emberwake*, a sturdy vessel captained by Harlon Greaves. They were joined by two new companions: Dame Alenwyn Duskforge, a cleric of Aurion, and Zaka, a kobold whose home was overrun by a rising threat in the Deep Dark.

The first day at sea was calm, though Zaka brought grave news: the worm known as **Xal'Zul**, a fragmented lieutenant of Orcus, had stirred. One of its “mouths” had already broken free deep beneath Lambaro. 

During the voyage, Garrik discovered a crate marked with the sigil of the **Black Sepulcher**, a cult devoted to Orcus. That night, Kibo and Spike investigated the cargo, uncovering dangerous relics intended for delivery in Boba.

These relics included:
- A scroll labeled **"Scroll of Warding Dissolution"**—a specialized *Dispel Magic* spell meant to break divine bindings.
- A verse page containing **Xal’Zul’s Second Verse**, designed to awaken bindings when spoken.
- Multiple cursed ritual items linked to the Whispering Choir and other “Mouth” unsealing rites.
- A black orb identified as a **resonance cyst**, containing the **Third Verse** of Xal'Zul.

Spike received a vision upon identifying the cyst, learning it was a **song trap**, a sleeper artifact designed to awaken psionic echoes in divine spaces. Exposure to leyline interference during travel had prematurely triggered the cyst, resulting in a psychic hum and corrupted compass behavior.

Zaka also began muttering ancient verses in Draconic. When Boud touched him, Boud received a vision of a warped temple altar and a cryptic prophecy:  
> *"You carry fire, you carry seals, but not the name. He who speaks the final verse will open the hymn’s throat. Don’t listen to her when she sings."*

Realizing the grave danger, the party destroyed most of the relics, retaining only a few for evidence. Kibo burned the second verse and stowed the scroll. Spike and Varis used divine magic to obliterate null-glyph stones meant to desecrate sacred sites.

On Day 2 of the voyage, the *Emberwake* passed through a leyline convergence, triggering magical interference and attracting a strange black-sailed vessel that mirrored their path before turning away.

As dinner concluded, the crew spotted a **lifeboat adrift** on the sea, bearing a soaked, unconscious woman—**Sister Malira**, wrapped in prayer beads, her lips parting as if to sing a song not her own.

---

## 🧩 Key Findings

- **Cultist Cargo**: Relics tied to Xal'Zul are being delivered to Boba via smuggled crates marked with Black Sepulcher symbols.
- **Resonance Cyst**: A powerful relic holding the Third Verse of Xal’Zul, designed to overwrite divine rituals.
- **Verse Fragment**: Kibo found and burned the Second Verse, preventing it from being spoken aloud and triggering a full awakening.
- **Drop-Off Manifest**: A coded note identified *Tobias Greyash* in Kanda’s Chapel Quarter as a recipient of the artifacts. Delivery was timed to follow the second moon’s wane (Dawn 09).
- **Temple Vision**: Boud received a vision and warning from an unknown force as Zaka recited a verse—suggesting a dangerous fourth verse or traitorous force yet to act.

## 🔚 Session End Hook
