## 🧭 Session Summary

The party continued their stay in Blackwater Crossing, unraveling the eerie mysteries tied to the recent demonic activity and whispered remnants of the deep. They learned that a strange map—left behind in a returned satchel—seemed to react to the leyline-seeped ground around the ruined chapel and a building by the lake.

After a tense negotiation with Scraps and Relic, local couriers, the party agreed to complete their next delivery in exchange for the map. This led to a strange encounter with a woman named [[01 Campaign/03 Entities/04 NPCs/Shadowthread Warrens/Blackwater Crossing/Tem Solven|Knight-Archivist]] and a dwarven paladin named [[Commander Ygra Brambleward]], who bore the sigil of the Silent Shield.

Upon delivering the key, the party learned that this map might not just be a delivery record, but a carrier of psionic memory—linking two binding sites for a fragment of **Xal’Zul**, a demonic entity bound during the Rising. Tem and Yagra confirmed that both the chapel and the lakefront building marked on the map are tied to a seal holding back one of the seven "Mouths" of [[01 Campaign/03 Entities/02c Orcus' Lieutenants/Xal'Zul|Xal’Zul the Choir of Worms]].

Faced with rising dread, the party chose to aid the two guardians in reinforcing the seal near the lake through a harmonic resonance ritual. The ritual initially succeeded, but faltered in its final moments—**Rickter** involuntarily spoke a verse from the unsealing litany, suggesting a partial failure. The seal did not break, but the mouth remembers them.

Finally, the group decided to head directly to the burnt chapel, now in possession of the key needed to access the vault below—where **Solvane’s flame** may yet burn and the next binding ritual must be attempted.

## 🔍 Key Revelations

- The **map** is a psionic carrier, not mundane parchment—possibly a sentient memory probe.
- **Xal’Zul**, also known as *the Choir of Worms*, is a memory-based demon shattered into seven psionic fragments during the Rising.
- Two of these fragments (or “Mouths”) are anchored in **Blackwater Crossing**—one beneath the ruined chapel and another near the lakefront delivery site.
- **Commander Yagra** is a paladin of Aurion and Silent Shield warden, holding vigil over one mouth.
- **Knight-Archivist Tem Solven**, keeper of the burned temple of Solvane (the Ember Saint), is guardian of the second.

---

## 🎯 Ritual Summary – Seal Reinforcement (Lakefront Site)

- The ritual required multiple phases of Arcana, Religion, and skill checks tied to glyphs, resonance, and echo harmonics.
- The party narrowly succeeded at most stages.
- In the final phase, Rickter involuntarily spoke a verse of awakening.
- **Partial Failure Outcome**: The Mouth is still sealed, but it remembers the party and has begun to stir.

## 📌 Session Leads & Action Items

- ⚠️ **Next Objective**: Perform the reinforcement ritual at the **ruined chapel**.

- 🧠 Scraps and his fellow couriers were found **dead** near the chapel—likely silenced by the forces seeking to unbind Xal’Zul.

## 🎭 Notable NPCs

- **Knight-Archivist Tem Solven** – Human archivist and guardian of the seal beneath the chapel, keeper of the ruined temple of Solvane.
- **Commander Yagra Brambleward** – Dwarven paladin of Aurion, protector of the lakefront mouth.
- **Xal’Zul / the Choir of Worms** – Demon Lieutenant of Orcus; a fragmented memory-parasite.

## 🧠 Lore Fragments

- Xal’Zul was bound through **hymns, memory sacrifice, and harmonic resonance**.
- The gods **Lunara, Aurion, Eldath, and others** helped scatter Xal’Zul’s mind into seven Mouths during the Rising.
- These mouths were hidden in the Underdark, beneath leyline-infused structures.

## ⏭️ Session End Hook

The party now descends into the sanctum beneath the chapel, seeking to rekindle the Flame of Solvane and reinforce the failing seal before another Mouth awakens.
