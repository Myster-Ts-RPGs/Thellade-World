# 📜 Campaign Group 4 – Session 5 Notes
**Date (In-Game):** Dawn 02–03, 212 PR  
**Location:** The Gilded Hound Inn → Sanctum of the Dawnsplit Crown  
**System:** Pathfinder 2e (Remaster)  
**Session Title:** *Ash in the Hollow Wake*

---

## 🧭 Session Start  
**Time:** 02 Dawnmarch, 212 PR – Late Evening  
**Location:** Private lounge of the Gilded Hound Inn

---

### 🔶 Scene I: The Pact Revealed – The Meeting at the Gilded Hound

**Present NPCs:**  
- 👑 Madame Orielle Varnassian – Proprietor of the Gilded Hound  
- 🧑‍⚖️ Chief Magistrate Varek  
- 📚 Elda Brightspark – Cleric of Lunara and Arcane Historian (Arcane Wardens)  
- 🧀 Ghelp – Kobold field agent and arcane observer (Arcane Wardens)

#### Summary of Discussion:
- The failed ritual from Session 4 was meant to **reinforce a divine seal**, not summon a demon. The seal held back **Veltrazhar**, one of **Orcus’ six lieutenants**.
- The ritual failed when the Asmodean paladin was killed. He was not summoning—he was *anchoring*.
- During the **Rising**, the **Arcane Wardens** forged a multi-deity pact. **Asmodeus** contributed to the binding of the lieutenants. This came at the cost of diminishing global magic.
- The seal failure was not due to external demonic power, but likely from **a breach of the original contract**—either accidental or deliberate.
- The party was shown recovered historical materials from Orielle’s vault:
  - *Ash and Ember: The Burning of Old Jambito*
  - *The Binding of Red Ash*
  - *Beneath the Stone: The Lost Ways of Jambito*

---

### 🔶 Scene II: Echoes from the Seal – Prophecy and Pathways

From the party’s research and the discussion:
- Jambito was one of the six cities housing **binding seals**.
- A **“Twilight Corridor”** may still exist beneath the collapsed districts—connecting to a Pre-Rising shrine once aligned to **both Aurion and Asmodeus**.
- The **Twilight Seal** is suggested to have been **dual-aspected**, using light and law to bind Veltrazhar’s essence.
- Elda suspects that **Veltrazhar’s true name** was fractured—not erased—and may be recoverable through echoes and mirror-binding rituals.
- Ghelp warns the party that **echoes often linger** when a soul like Veltrazhar’s is released unnaturally, especially if his anchor was incomplete.

---

### 🔶 Scene III: The Echo Strikes – Ambush at the Gilded Hound

**Time:** 03 Dawnmarch, 212 PR – Approx. 1:20 AM  
**Location:** Private suites, Gilded Hound Inn

- As the party attempted to rest upstairs, they were ambushed in their rooms by a **manifestation of Veltrazhar’s Echo** and **Mawbound cultists**.
- The **Echo-Wraith** whispered fragments of prophecy and blame, including:
  > “First to echo… last to stand.”  
  > “You broke the vow. You are the wound.”
- The party fought unarmored, roused from sleep.
- Jesher and Nylkar suffered psychic feedback during the encounter.
- A **radiant golden flash**—a surge of divine grace from **Aurion**—intervened, pulling the party from danger.

#### Divine Intervention:
- The party was **banished from the echo-space** and deposited outside the inn—**spiritually intact, but shaken**.
- This mirrored a **Divine Extraction** previously experienced by Campaign Group 2.

---

### 🔶 Scene IV: The Sanctum Beckons – Arrival at the Dawnsplit Crown

**Time:** 04 Dawnmarch, 212 PR – Approx. 10:00 AM  
**Location:** Sanctum of the Dawnsplit Crown, Outside Time and Space

- The party, still unarmored and exhausted, arrived at the Sanctum seeking safety.
- **Only party members** arrived—no NPCs accompanied them.
- They were granted a secluded space beneath the stained-glass solar, where they began to recover.
- Their dreams remain uneasy. The **unraveling of the seals has begun**.

---

# ✅ Session 5 Summary – Key Points

- 🧩 The party confirmed the seal was part of a divine pact involving Asmodeus and the Arcane Wardens.
- 📚 Research indicated that the failed seal was **dual-aspected** and that Veltrazhar’s name may be recovered.
- 🕯️ They were attacked by an **Echo-Wraith** and cultists, but survived thanks to **Aurion’s intervention**.
- 🏛️ The party ended the session at the **Sanctum of the Dawnsplit Crown**, shaken but alive.
