## Post
### New Creations
- Party now branded with hidden divine sigils from Aron, Lunara, and Velessa.
- These divine marks allow travel through time barriers and signal party as ‚Äúbeacons of hope.‚Äù
- Heroic Items distributed directly reflect each character‚Äôs potential role in upcoming conflicts.

### Detailed Notes from Transcript and VTT Log
- Session opens with cinematic reintroduction to the *Time-Locked Temple of Aurion*.
- Party recovers from last session‚Äôs combat and is healed by **Herald Elanor**, the final timebound cleric of Aurion.
- Two new characters‚Äî**Antumbra** and **Elanor (PC)**‚Äîare revealed to have also been summoned by the sanctum.
- The Herald explains the *sanctum lies outside of time*, existing as a safe haven from the Abyssal threat.
- A **social encounter** unfolds where the Herald evaluates whether each PC is worthy of divine knowledge:
  - All six PCs succeed through narrative skills: performance, stealth, athletics, religion, medicine, thievery.
- Upon proving themselves, the Herald recounts:
  - **The Rising**, the arrival of interplanar refugees, and the multi-god effort to seal the Abyssal Lieutenants.
  - The trade with Asmodeus: magic for containment.
  - The slow collapse of seals now threatens Thellade.
  - Six lieutenants confirmed either *released* or *still bound*:
    - **Veltrazhar (Jambito)** ‚Äì released
    - **Azael (Lambaro)** ‚Äì released
    - **Threxul (Seaside Cape)** ‚Äì released
    - **Goriath** ‚Äì rebound, but still dangerous
    - **Zal‚ÄôZul, Choir of Worms** ‚Äì fragmented into seven Mouths, some now failing.
- The Herald warns that if 3‚Äì4 of Xal‚ÄôZul‚Äôs Mouths fall, a cascade collapse will follow.
- The gods have marked the party as chosen to aid in these battles.
- Final exchange includes party deciding **to return to the Radiant Temple in Kanda**, under **Sister Seralyne Vireth** of the Dawnbringers of Lunara.
- Kieran remains with the party, apparently shaken but committed to following this path.
- Final moment: the party is branded with divine sigils and teleported back to the material plane‚Äîto Kanda.
