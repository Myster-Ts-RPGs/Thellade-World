## 🧭 Session Summary

The party pressed forward into the long-forgotten sanctum beneath Lambaro, chasing down the Red Runner cultist who fled during the previous session’s skirmish. What they found was no ordinary hideout—it was a ritual site. At the center stood a half-formed entity, Azael the Bleeding Crown, bound in glowing chains and slowly growing more corporeal as cultists chanted infernal hymns to Orcus.

The encounter escalated rapidly into a chaotic battle across broken stone and sacred runes. Cultists defended the central altar while mercenary guards and a Red Runner wizard provided ranged support. Every few rounds, the ritual reached a crescendo, erupting in flames across the battlefield—hazards that both friend and foe had to endure.

Amidst the fire and blood, the party realized the true stakes: the cultists were attempting to unseal Azael. With every chant and every fallen enemy, his presence solidified further. Flames burst forth from abyssal traps inscribed into the very stones of the floor, forcing the heroes to carefully manage positioning and pressure.

Through coordinated strikes, spellwork, and musical encouragement from Kieran, the party cut down the cultists and their guards one by one. But even with the last of the chanters slain, Azael's form was now complete. He addressed the party directly, promising death, fire, and dominion.

Just as Azael was about to strike, Husara, seeing the rising darkness, charged the entity with a final cry to Aurion: *“Then let it in with fire and steel. Not one more chain. Not one more breath!”* Flames erupted in full fury—and then...

Aurion’s light interceded. Each party member witnessed a divine vision of an ancient temple dedicated to the Sun God, lost to time and now emerging in their memory. The sanctum collapsed inward on itself with harmonic resonance. The ritual was stopped—just barely.

The party awoke on the cold, cracked stones of a sunlit ruin far removed from the battlefield. Azael had been repelled—but not destroyed. Husara was gone.
