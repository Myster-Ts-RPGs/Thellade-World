## ⚔️ Recap

### 🔥 Battle Conclusion
The session resumed mid-battle, picking up with the remaining four enemies after the death of Captain Verin Draasque. Combat proceeded with tactical positioning and careful use of splash damage. Highlights included:
- Batrok effectively using alchemical bombs, applying splash damage to grouped enemies.
- Karnak identifying enemy weaknesses through Recall Knowledge.
- The cutthroat inflicting minor damage but ultimately falling.
- Strategic use of cover and darkvision allowed the party to pick off ranged threats.

### 🎒 Aftermath & Interrogation
Following victory, the party moved to secure the smuggler’s den. Notes, symbols, and coded correspondence hinted at wider operations connected to the Bleeding Tide and their infernal contacts.
- Several bandits were captured and interrogated. Notable dialogue included confessions about:
  - Shipment schedules and smuggling routes.
  - Partial knowledge of the cult’s interest in relics stored in city vaults.
  - Mentions of the name **Zorvithrax**, though without context.
  - Hints of a “traitor” in the government or clergy.

### 🏛 Return to City Hall
The group returned to City Hall with two prisoners: Borek Jundar and a surviving footpad. Borek was handed over to the city authorities, while Kothar personally escorted the lesser captive to the **Temple of Aurion**.

Inside the hall, the group gave their debrief to city officials, receiving both political praise and veiled suspicion. Some authorities questioned their growing influence and whether the Crystal Seekers were aware of these developments.

### 🍷 The Velvet Lantern
Later, the party visited **The Velvet Lantern**, Mangagoy’s upscale tavern and information hub. While enjoying a much-needed reprieve:
- Kothar and Lunair discussed the dream vision Kothar received earlier in the week—a divine message relating to an ancient barrier weakening.
- Tian Ling received a cryptic letter from a former associate tied to the Emberheart Traders.
- Rumors swirled around the docks about “crimson-robed figures” seen in the sewers beneath the Healing Sanctuary.
- The tavern’s matron hinted at having old Pre-Rising documents for sale—an expensive but enticing offer.

## 🌙 Divine Dream – Recap
Kothar’s vision was described in poetic detail during the session, a divine message from Aurion:
> “Seven mouths cry in silence. The chain shudders. The ember moon bleeds. Follow the blade etched in gold, where flame once knelt. Beyond the veil, the lie sleeps... but wakes.”

## 🧩 Summary
- The Bleeding Tide’s leadership is broken for now, but evidence suggests a deeper operation remains.
- The cult of Orcus is active in Mangagoy, though their reach remains unclear.
- The city is on edge. The barrier binding the abyss is weakening.
- The party’s influence is growing—but so is the danger.
