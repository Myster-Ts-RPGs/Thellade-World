## ⚔️ Recap

### 🌙 Morning Reflections at the Velvet Lantern
The party awoke beneath the Velvet Lantern following their recent battle. Dreams and omens weighed heavily, especially for Batrok and Kothar. The morning was subdued, marked by quiet reflection, a sparse breakfast, and brief discussion of strange visions.

- Batrok described a dream in which a beast swallowed the moon.
- Kothar received a divine echo, warning him of a path tied to Lunair’s struggle.

### 🌿 Journey into the Jungle
Driven by the urgency of their dreams and the faint divine pull sensed by Karnak, the party ventured into the Mangagoy jungle.

A five-phase group skill challenge followed, highlighting:
- Use of Nature and Survival to trace beast movements.
- Perception and Arcana to detect illusions and lingering corruption.
- Reflexive decisions to avoid jungle hazards.

The group succeeded, navigating the dense terrain and locating a ruin pulsing with celestial and abyssal resonance.

### 🐾 The Beast and the Bond
At the heart of the ruins, the party encountered a massive werebeast locked in combat with Lunair. The beast was Kaleor Thornhide—once a druid and guardian of the region.

A fierce battle ensued. Tactical use of spellstrike, divine magic, and physical positioning ultimately felled Kaleor. Upon his defeat, Lunair approached Karnak, recognizing his spiritual resonance and solidifying their bond.

### 🏥 Return and Rituals
The party brought the unconscious Kaleor back to the Mangagoy House of Healing. There, they reunited with **Priestess Vaelis Duskwhisper**, now recovering.

- Vaelis conducted a divine reading, unveiling a ritual memory of Kaleor’s corruption.
- The group saw Maelthaz, former Lunaran priest, perform a ritual involving the devouring of Kaleor’s name.
- Kaleor is marked as a vessel of Zorvithrax, cursed to carry an echo of the Verse.

Vaelis vowed to attempt a cleansing ritual during the full moon.

## 🌙 Divine Vision – Ritual of Unnaming
> “When the seal is named, the chain holds. When the name is stolen, the gate breaks. He is marked… not just by darkness—but by prophecy. If Zorvithrax rises, it will be through him first.”

## 🧩 Summary
- Kaleor Thornhide, a once-faithful druid, was cursed and twisted into a vessel of Zorvithrax.
- Maelthaz, a traitorous priest of Lunara, was responsible for Kaleor’s fall.
- Lunair now walks beside Karnak as a bonded companion.
- The full moon will determine whether Kaleor can be redeemed—or destroyed.
