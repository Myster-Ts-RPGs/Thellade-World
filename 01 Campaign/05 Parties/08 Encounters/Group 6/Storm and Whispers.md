### ðŸ§© Stage 1: Currents Beneath the Calm  
**Description:**  
Ten miles off Kandaâ€™s reefline, a false calm overtakes the sea. The clouds have parted, but beneath the glassy surface, things shift. A resonant hum vibrates through the hull, barely perceptible to non-spellcasters.

**Skill Options:**  
- **Survival (DC 18)** â€“ Help chart a safe course compensating for cross-drift  
- **Nature (DC 19)** â€“ Analyze the behavior of seabirds and fish fleeing the path ahead  
- **Athletics (DC 20)** â€“ Assist with tension lines as drag currents begin to torque the hull  
- **Perception (DC 20)** â€“ Spot undercurrents by tracking floating debris and seafoam  

**Success Effect:**  
Early correction avoids structural stress; no additional penalties applied  

**Failure Consequence:**  
Course destabilized; Acrobatics and Reflex checks  receive â€“1 status penalty in Stage 2 

### ðŸ§© Stage 2: The Whisperwake Swell  
**Description:**  
The winds drop suddenlyâ€”then return in a thundering burst. Whispers ride the gale. The crew mutters about old sea-tales where drowned voices steer ships to ruin.

**Skill Options:**  
- **Acrobatics (DC 18)** â€“ Stabilize footing and navigate crosswind patterns  
- **Arcana (DC 19)** â€“ Isolate the magical resonance and suggest course corrections  
- **Thievery (DC 20)** â€“ Reseal and brace loose gear before it becomes deadly debris  
- **Reflex Save (DC 20)** â€“ Catch yourself mid-slip as the deck shifts underfoot  

**Success Effect:**  
Ritual and deck equipment remain secure; Crafting rolls in Stage 3 gain +1  

**Failure Consequence:**  
Flying gear injures a deckhand; morale drops, Diplomacy and Religion suffer â€“1 status penalty in Stage 3  

### ðŸ§© Stage 3: Eye of the Unspoken  
**Description:**  
As the Emberwake pushes through the stillness, a break in the clouds reveals a shape beneath the water. Massive. Watching. It does not attackâ€”but it is known. The crew begins to pray.

**Skill Options:**  
- **Diplomacy (DC 19)** â€“ Keep the crew focused and calm in the face of awe  
- **Stealth (DC 19)** â€“ Adjust wake and helm to pass silently over the lurking thing  
- **Crafting (DC 20)** â€“ Reinforce strain points where the ship creaks under tension  
- **Religion (DC 20)** â€“ Lead a deckwide rite of appeasement  

**Success Effect:**  
Crew steadies themselves through fear; no morale penalties in Stage 4  

**Failure Consequence:**  
Whispers deepenâ€”Stage 4 Athletics and Intimidation checks suffer â€“1  in Stage 4

### ðŸ§© Stage 4: Fire in the Fog  
**Description:**  
Sudden static arcs crackle across the water. The fog returnsâ€”but it glows from within, streaked with lightning and glowing glyph-light. The sea smells of blood and burnt kelp.

**Skill Options:**  
- **Intimidation (DC 19)** â€“ Force crew into action before they freeze up  
- **Society (DC 19)** â€“ Recall naval legends tied to this phenomenon and act accordingly  
- **Athletics (DC 20)** â€“ Execute sharp-angle tacking to ride just ahead of the surges  
- **Acrobatics (DC 20)** â€“ Climb and release caught rigging to prevent collapse  

**Success Effect:**  
Storm mostly avoided; Stage 5 DCs remain at baseline  

**Failure Consequence:**  
Static backlash warps instruments; Stage 5 DCs increase by 1  


### ðŸ§© Stage 5: Dread Horizon  
**Description:**  
The horizon darkens unnaturally as if something waits at the threshold of the stormâ€™s edge. Each breath is labored. The ship feels like it's being drawn toward something it cannot see.

**Skill Options:**  
- **Performance (DC 20)** â€“ Calm the crew and party members 
- **Athletics (DC 20)** â€“ Hold a straining tiller or anchor against an unseen force  
- **Survival (DC 20)** â€“ Gauge barometric shifts and cloudline changes for escape  
- **Fortitude Save (DC 20)** â€“ Resist the oppressive presence pressing against your lungs  
- **Religion (DC 20)** â€“ Request assistance from your deity in subduing the storm
- **Occultism (DC 20)** â€“ Force the entity to assist the ship instead of hindering
- **Deception (DC 20)** â€“ Pretend that nothing is wrong and that nobody should be worried

**Success Effect:**  
The ship breaks free of the pressure zone, skies ahead begin to clear  

**Failure Consequence:**  
Residual pressure causes sea-sickness and crew fatigue; â€“1 to all interactions upon arrival unless rested
