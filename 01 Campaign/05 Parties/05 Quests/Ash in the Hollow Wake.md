# 📜 Quest: Ash in the Hollow Wake

## 🎯 Summary
While investigating smuggler activity beneath Blackwater Crossing, the party stumbles upon a hidden Pre-Rising vault linked to the original binding of **Xal’Zul, the Choir of Worms**. At the same time Group 6 experiences leyline resonance aboard the *Emberwake*, the Rootcoil Smuggler Cell prepares to unlock a vault beneath the lake—unaware they may be shattering a harmonic seal keeping the Choir imprisoned. The party must decide whether to interfere, assist, or harness what lies beneath.

## 🗺️ Quest Structure

### Act I – The Stone That Hums
- Rootcoil Smugglers plan a delivery run to the “Sealed Dock” using a pathstone that has begun to resonate abnormally.
- Players are offered a courier job, warned by Marnie, or sense divine interference near the chapel.
- Party investigates leyline fluctuation, possibly discovers the pathstone’s reaction is tied to distant seal-breaking (i.e., Threxul’s release).

### Act II – Vault Beneath the Black Lake
- Players explore a submerged Pre-Rising shrine under the lake.
- They find a partially broken psionic relic: a **Whispershard Resonator**.
- Combat or negotiation may unfold with smugglers; ley-harmonics build pressure.
- Players uncover the **Second Verse** carved into the vault stone and evidence this site was a harmonic anchor used to bind Xal’Zul.

### Act III – The Choir Begins to Hum
- The vault begins to vibrate as a distant leyline pulse surges (in parallel with Zakka’s vision on the Emberwake).
- Players must decide to:
  - Stabilize the vault (risky, slow)
  - Destroy the relic (sacrifices memory or divine link)
  - Let it open and deal with what comes next
- One of the “Seven Mouths” is now breached. Whispers spread in town.

### Act IV (Optional) – Fallout or Reward
- Divine casters feel interference in Refocus actions across Blackwater.
- Scraps is mentally affected, Rellik physically wounded.
- Vissra becomes a permanent contact if spared.
- Word spreads: something ancient stirs beneath the lake.
