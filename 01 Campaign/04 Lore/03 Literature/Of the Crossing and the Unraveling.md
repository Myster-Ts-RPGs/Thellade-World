## Overview
## ðŸ“œ "Of the Crossing and the Unraveling"

*Author Unknown â€“ attributed to a Pre-Rising survivor of the Time Wars, likely an arcane chronicler or divine witness. Recovered from a sealed codex preserved in aetherglass casing.*

---

**I have no name worth speaking. I left it on the bridge.  
This record remains because I remainâ€”and I remain only because [[Thellade]] was spared.**

I write of what came before the silence. Before the seals. Before the memory of memory was undone.

We called it *war* at firstâ€”what we now name the *Time Wars*. But there was no enemy we could face. No fortress to breach, no army to defy. Onlyâ€¦ collapse. Across the worlds of the [[Material Plane]], time itself began to fray. Trees bloomed before they grew. Rivers flowed in spirals. Magic rebelled against its own intent.

And thenâ€¦ it came.

We did not give it a name. We gave it **a warning**.  
We called it *[[The Dark One]]* not because it was shadowâ€”but because it was the absence of pattern. The absence of *being*. Where it moved, cause and effect broke down. Nothing died. Things simplyâ€¦ ceased to be.

The gods saw it. Felt it. And for once, they acted not in rivalry but in unity.

They built the bridgesâ€”not gates, not portals, but divine threads of light braided from all pantheons. They reached across the fractured lands to gather those who could still flee. Thellade, untouched and unsullied, became the last shore.

I remember the crossing.

We walked roads of starlight. Songs were sung in twelve tongues. Priests of rival gods held hands. Children too young to understand clutched relics older than cities.

And then we saw it.

Not a shape. Not a storm. A place where the bridge ahead had begun to unweave. Where time unraveled like wet parchment. Behind us, the bridges pulsedâ€”growing hotter, thinner, drawn tight by what hunted them.

The gods took position. I saw [[Aurion]] blaze brighter than a sun, and Asmodeus encircle him in law-forged rings. Even [[Urrogg]] howled not in bloodlust, but in defiance.

Together, they severed the bridges. They **cut** themselves from the rest of the Material Plane.

I felt it. A pull in the marrow. A stillness in my breath.

And then it was gone.

[[The Dark One]] was scatteredâ€”not banished, not slain, but spread so thin across the planes that its purpose fractured. It could no longer act. It had no center. And so, for a timeâ€¦ we were safe.

---

But the cost was steep.

The gods turned inward again. What unity they found, they buried beneath silence and doctrine. Some lost power. Others turned bitter. The great truth of the Crossing became legend, then myth, then blasphemy to speak aloud.

I write this not for glory. I write this so someone, somewhere, will remember **why the bridges were built**, and **why they were burned**.

Because if the veil stirs againâ€¦  
It will not come as shadow.  
It will come as silence.

**And you will know it by the way your name forgets itself.**
