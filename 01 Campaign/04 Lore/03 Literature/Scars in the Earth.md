## Overview

_“Scars in the Earth”_ is a first-person field memoir chronicling the final year leading up to the Rising. [[Devrik Thorne]], a wounded soldier and scribe of [[the Ashen Vanguard]], bore witness to numerous campaigns against demonic incursion, cult activity, and infernal pacts. His account is unique for its unfiltered tone — emotionally raw, politically charged, and interwoven with battlefield sketches and unsent letters.

The book stands apart for revealing key early signs of  [[01 Campaign/02 Factions/03 Organization/03b Secret Factions/The Infernal Covenant]]’s involvement in reinforcing the barrier, as well as subtle criticisms of how the Vanguard was ordered to cover it up.
## Contents
### **Prologue: Burnt Leaves in Spring**

> Introduces Devrik's role as a forward scout during a deployment in the Kanda Lowlands. Documents initial signs of abyssal soil corruption and the Vanguard’s response with fire magic and divine wards.

### **Chapter 1: The Black Sky Hungered**

> Chronicles a 48-hour siege against infernal warbeasts in a coastal village outside [[Lambaro]]. Includes first mention of the sigil-split — a glyph malfunction tied to a Pre-Rising leyline breach.

### **Chapter 2: Orders from Shadows**

> Recounts when Vanguard squads began receiving directives through sealed glyphscrolls — origin unknown but later revealed to be from the “Covenant Tribunal.” Soldiers begin to suspect they are not just following the King’s command.

### **Chapter 3: Ash in the Hollow Wake**

> A haunting description of a failed ritual site. All arcane participants perished, but their glyphs continued burning in the ground. First mention of “the Whispering Hand” by name in public record.

### **Chapter 4: Steel Without Sleep**

> Details how Vanguard detachments were ordered to stand guard over broken seals for weeks without magical reinforcement. Includes field sketches and the infamous line: “We were the gate, and none told us what we held back.”

### **Chapter 5: The Pact We Cannot Name**

> A chapter censored in most versions. Surviving fragments describe a forced collaboration with devils at the height of the crisis. One passage implies that Commander [[Thalos Greybeard]] “knew more than he could admit.”

### **Appendix: Wounds Unhealed**

> A postscript containing letters never sent to Thorne’s surviving family. Reflects on the silence imposed after the Rising, and fears that the price they paid may one day be undone.

## Notes
- This book is referenced in several Arcane Wardens and Ashen Vanguard entries as controversial and “unapproved for general distribution.”
- Group 6's NPC mentor [[Ulthar]] once quoted a line similar to one found in Chapter 4, possibly implying he had read or heard parts of the text.
- **No group has canonically discovered or claimed this book** as of Session 7 across all groups.
- Could be placed in:
    - A sealed archive within [[01 Campaign/01 World/08 Points of Interest/01 Factions/The Ashen Vanguard/Fort Redstone]]
    - The restricted section of the [[01 Campaign/01 World/08 Points of Interest/06 Library, Archive, School, Research/The Outcast Isles/Kanda Islands/Sunfire Tower]]
    - A confiscated item in a future dungeon or cult lair
- It would make a compelling **quest hook**: uncovering the full, uncensored version.
