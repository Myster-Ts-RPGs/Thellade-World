## Overview

Blossomveil marks the height of spring across the Outcast Isles—a month of blooming excess, political resurgence, and delicate maneuverings. Named for the seasonal veil of flower petals that blanket many inland regions, the month brings fragrant winds, clear skies, and the first great maritime festivals of the year.

Many noble houses time their galas, duels, and announcements during Blossomveil to coincide with favorable omens and astrological alignments. Trade routes are flush with activity, and mercenary contracts rise in number as local lords seek to enforce borders, seize opportunities, or undercut rivals before the summer heat hardens allegiances. Spiritual orders celebrate the midpoint of renewal, while whispering cults make offerings in the deep places—hidden beneath the pageantry.

In 212 PR, Blossomveil is expected to bring diplomatic fallout from events in Boba, heightened activity along the coast of Jambito, and unprecedented interference in leyline channels beneath the Embercoil mountain range.
