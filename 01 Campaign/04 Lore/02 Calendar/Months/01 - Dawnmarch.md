## Overview

Dawnmarch marks the beginning of the calendar year across the Outcast Isles and much of Thellade. As the first month of Spring, it is a time of fresh beginnings, cautious optimism, and volatile transitions. Gentle rains break the last grasp of Frostfall’s chill, and the seas begin to thaw enough for regular shipping lanes to reopen.

Many settlements use this month to hold renewal festivals, perform cleansing rituals, and reestablish mercantile and political routines disrupted during the harsh winter. However, lingering tensions often accompany the thaw—pirates resume activity in the Sundering Deep, leyline surges become more volatile, and certain celestial alignments mark it as a favored time for abyssal cult movements.

In 212 PR, Dawnmarch is particularly volatile, with multiple sealed sites showing signs of weakening, widespread unrest in Boba, and troubling omens in Sunfire Tower.
