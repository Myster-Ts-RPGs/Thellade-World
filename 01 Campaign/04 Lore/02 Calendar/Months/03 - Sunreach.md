## Overview

Sunreach blazes as the first month of summer across the Outcast Isles, ushering in sweltering days, booming port traffic, and swelling tensions beneath golden skies. Named for the solar zenith celebrated across several coastal traditions, this month is synonymous with ambition, rivalry, and elemental unrest.

Markets overflow with foreign wares, and political agendas take center stage as festivals honoring the twin moons draw pilgrims, charlatans, and prophets alike. It is during Sunreach that arcane research intensifies, particularly around celestial phenomena and planar breaches. While communities host bonfires and sea-blessings, the heat fuels simmering unrest—criminal syndicates jockey for territory, and noble houses subtly draw battle lines.

In 212 PR, Sunreach is anticipated to culminate in a rare double full moon, drawing concern from astronomers and cult hunters alike. Forecasts warn of leyline distortions and sea-ritual anomalies—particularly in the regions of Boba and Seaside Cape.
