    desc: "_**Note**: Basic siege armies know Engines of War automatically, and must 'spend' their first tactic on it._\n* * *\n\nSiege engines cannot be outfitted with gear. They cannot attack [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] armies. They are more difficult to destroy due to their higher hit points than other basic armies. A siege engine can attack and damage fortifications with its ranged attacks as part of the [[Kingmaker Features/Battle|Battle]] or [[Kingmaker Features/Overwhelming Bombardment|Overwhelming Bombardment]] actions."
