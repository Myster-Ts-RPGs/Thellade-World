## 📖 Backstory Provenance

### 📍 Origin

- Belonged to **Warvan-son**, a dwarven spellcaster and mentor to Hans Dane.
    
- Warvan-son’s **oldest brother**, **Grabthar**, was a legendary enforcer of justice in their remote village.
    
- The medallion was **crafted in honor of Grabthar** and worn by Warvan-son as a badge of moral authority and memory.
    

### 📚 Role in Hans’ Upbringing

- Warvan-son taught Hans to channel magic for righteous ends, using stories of Grabthar’s hammer as parables for justice.
    
- When Hans misbehaved, Warvan-son would hold up the medallion and say:
    
    > _“By Grabthar’s hammer, justice falls on those who step out of line.”_
    
- These stories deeply inspired Hans’ worldview: that **true justice is earned, not enforced**.
    

---

### 💔 The Turning Point

- Hans visited Warvan-son one fateful day and found his mentor **murdered**, home ransacked.
    
- The **medallion was missing**—stolen by the bandits.
    
- Hans buried his mentor and swore:
    
    > _“By Grabthar’s hammer, by the sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged.”_
    
- This moment marked the beginning of Hans’ adventuring path: not for glory, but for justice.

## 🧭 Recent Movement in Mangagoy

### 🔻 Stage 1 — Unknown Cultist

- A **gaunt, red-robed stranger** (likely of **The Black Sepulcher** or a rogue from the **Infernal Covenant**) emerged from the [[Glowquarter]].
    
- Traded the medallion to Kellen Brasque for **dreamglass**, then disappeared into [[Gullsway]].
    
- The medallion's presence during a recent **Embermoon** may have triggered dormant magic or drawn it into leyline instability.
    

### 🔻 Stage 2 — Kellen Brasque (Merchant, [[Evercrate Exports]])

- Took possession of the medallion in [[Ashgate Market]].
    
- Instinctively knew it was dangerous.
    
- Quickly sold it to **Holin Barsh**, a known relic-smith in [[The Ember Wharf]].
    

### 🔻 Stage 3 — Holin Barsh (Relic-Smith, [[The Rivet & Rune]])

- Recognized the medallion’s **ancient, sacred craftsmanship**.
    
- Noted that it **vibrates faintly during the Embermoon** and reacts to leyline proximity.
    
- Currently stores it in a **sealed rune-coffer** within his forge.
    
- Is investigating the metal and glyphwork for divine or abyssal signatures but has not publicly declared its presence.

## 🔮 Speculative Significance

- The fractured sunburst behind the hammer could symbolize:
    
    - The **destruction of a lawful divine legacy**.
        
    - A **shattered divine pact** or one broken by betrayal (possibly tied to the same divine-forge energies that bound Xal’Zul).
        
    - A **suppressed identity**—perhaps even the **true name of Grabthar**, sealed or erased by the Choir of Worms.
        

---

## 🔐 Narrative Potential

- Hans may be tested: will he claim the medallion in vengeance, or preserve it as a legacy of justice?
    
- Holin Barsh may **refuse to release it** without assurance Hans can protect what it truly represents.
    
- The medallion may **awaken latent memories**, show **fragments of Warvan-son’s soul**, or resonate with one of the divine beacons.
    
- As the Embermoon wanes, the medallion could **serve as a stabilizer—or a trigger—in future ward failures** across Mangagoy.
# 🩸 Path of the Medallion: From Warvan-son’s Death to the Red-Robed Stranger

---

## 🏚️ The Murder of Warvan-son

- **Location:** Warvan-son’s cottage in a forested fringe-hamlet north of the [[Sundering Deep]] (outside the Outcast Isles—exact kingdom not yet declared; presumed inland settlement).
    
- **Date:** Approximately **5–6 years ago** (pre-campaign start; Hans was still young, unsure of his place in the world).
    

### 👥 Bandit Group Details

- **Name:** _The Hollow Brand_
    
- **Type:** Minor scavenger crew turned relic-hunters after the isolation
    
- **Size at time of attack:** 4–6 members
    
- **Affiliation:** Unaffiliated at the time—but some may later be recruited into fringe sects of **The Infernal Covenant**
    
- **Modus Operandi:**
    
    - Target elderly or hermit casters rumored to possess relics or hoarded arcana
        
    - Extract items of value, then fence or pass them to more powerful buyers
        
    - Leave no survivors
        

### 📍 Aftermath at the Scene

- Warvan-son fought back, wounding at least one attacker with spellburn (burned cloak found by Hans)
    
- The attackers ransacked the home, took the medallion (among other items), and left his body unburied
    
- Hans discovered the scene shortly after and swore his oath

## 🔁 Chain of Possession (Post-Theft)

### 🛣️ Step 1: Black Market Smuggling

- The medallion was sold to a **smuggler-fence** named **Arvek Dorn**, operating between scattered isles and port cities during the worst isolation years
    
- Arvek specialized in **Pre-Rising salvage**, shipping items into the Outcast Isles through minor docks
    
- The medallion was part of a mixed crate of minor trinkets—only Arvek noted its **abjuration residue** and **divine metalwork**
    

### 🪓 Step 2: Crate Seized by Cult Couriers

- During a shipment to the **Glowquarter** of Mangagoy, the crate was **intercepted by operatives of The Black Sepulcher**
    
- The cult had begun collecting objects with “binding echoes” for use in their rites—especially those showing resonance during moonrise
    
- **Red-Robed Stranger** was one such courier—tasked with evaluating dreamglass conduits and weak wards
    

### 🩸 Step 3: Red-Robed Stranger’s Bargain

- Upon discovering the medallion among the junk, the stranger bartered it to **Kellen Brasque** in **[[Ashgate Market]]** in exchange for **refined dreamglass powder** (possibly used for a ritual or as a leyline resonator)
    
- The stranger vanished toward **[[Gullsway]]**, last seen muttering verses in reverse speech and leaving behind warped coinage

## 🔍 Narrative Details and Hooks

- The **Hollow Brand** is now scattered; one or more members may be operating under new names or dead.
    
- **Arvek Dorn** is alive, old, and possibly retired—he could offer Hans insight into the black market trail if tracked down.
    
- The red-robed stranger may have **identified the medallion’s true origin**, and intentionally passed it into the city to **destabilize Holin’s forge** or draw attention to the Embermoon beacon.
    
- The medallion now links **Hans’ past**, **Zorvithrax’s schemes**, and the **weakening divine wards** across Mangagoy.
## 🧿 **Grabthar’s Legacy** – Relic Boon

**Item:** Hans' Medallion  
**Type:** Worn Relic (Neck slot)  
**Rarity:** Rare  
**Activation:** Passive + 1/day Reaction  
**Trait Tags:** Divine, Relic, Resonant, Justice, Lawful (optional), Legacy

---

### 📌 **Passive Effect – “Aura of Equitable Judgment”**

When Hans wears the medallion, his mere presence subtly influences divine echoes around him.

- **+1 status bonus** to **Religion**, **Occultism**, or **Arcana** checks made to identify or interact with **binding seals**, **divine glyphwork**, or **leyline anomalies**.
    
- Once per day, Hans may automatically know whether an action or effect in his presence **violates a divine pact** or **shatters a sacred binding** _(as if via detect alignment, but only in cases of spiritual breach or broken oaths)_.
    

---

### 🛡️ **Resonant Power – “By Grabthar’s Hammer”**

**Trigger:** An ally is targeted by a harmful spell, or Hans witnesses an act of injustice (e.g., an innocent harmed, a broken oath, a prisoner struck).  
**Effect (1/day Reaction):** The medallion emits a flash of divine force:

- Hans gains **resistance 5** to the triggering damage type **(or +2 to saving throw)** until the start of his next turn
    
- The attacker must succeed at a **Will save (DC = Hans' class DC)** or become **Frightened 1** and **Flat-Footed until the end of its next turn**
    

This effect intensifies during celestial conjunctions (Embermoon full + Deimos new):

- On such nights, Hans may activate the power **twice per day**, and the **Frightened condition increases to 2** if the Will save is failed by 10+.

### ⚖️ **Narrative Layer – Oathbound Radiance**

If Hans willingly takes a **vow of justice**, codified through roleplay (not mechanics), the medallion may **grow in power**, eventually revealing:

- Echoes of Warvan-son’s voice
    
- Fragments of Grabthar’s original oaths
    
- Keys to lost Warden Seals buried across the Outcast Isles
