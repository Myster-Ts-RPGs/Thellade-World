## üåø Relic: The Verdant Crown

- **Deity:** [[Faylen]], Goddess of Renewal, Wild Beauty, and Reclamation  
- **Region:** [[Kingdom of Serrulata]]  
- **Resting Site:** Rootstone Hollow, once beneath the Palace Gardens of [[Bergav]]

### Description:
Forged from woven living vines, iridescent moss, and braided locks of druidic oath-hair, *The Verdant Crown* pulses faintly with a slow, earthy rhythm‚Äîas though breathing. The roots react to the presence of decay, tightening like a fist, and bloom only in the presence of true healing or renewal.

- **Divine Trait:** Grows only where old growth has died. Will not manifest its full power in untouched land.
- **Relic Boons (Narrative Tier):**
  - **Voice of the Rootheart** ‚Äî Grants communion with natural sites tied to the Crown, allowing the bearer to awaken ancestral memories embedded in ancient flora.
  - **Bloom Against the Blight** ‚Äî Once per day, may cast a heightened *purify* effect in a 60-foot radius that suppresses necrotic effects, abyssal taint, and corruption for 1 minute.
  - **Reclaim the Wound** ‚Äî In a corrupted biome, may trigger a Rebirth Surge, forcing dead flora to regrow explosively for 1 hour, providing cover, passage, or blinding terrain (DM discretion).

### Current Status:
The Crown lies dormant beneath Bergav, sealed in a druidic Rootvault. However, abyssal corruption has begun to spread underground. Black Sepulcher agents are believed to be disturbing the vaults to twist the relic into a weapon of necrotic growth.

## üé® Cinematic Description: City of Bergav (Capital of Serrulata)

> *‚ÄúThe trees here remember when they ruled the world.‚Äù*

Bergav rises like a garden half-consumed by memory. Ivy-choked steeples and hollowed birch towers pierce the skyline‚Äîliving architecture grafted onto ancient stone. Bridges woven from tree limbs stretch across green gorges, connecting bastion to bastion, their bark engraved with centuries of prayers.

Mist drapes the lower levels like mourning veils. The streets are cobbled not in stone, but in root and petrified vine. Lanterns of glowing pollen drift on breeze-currents shaped by subtle druidic magic. Even the guards wear leaf-laced armor and speak softly among the branches.

At its heart stands the **Glade Citadel**, a fortress-palace where oaks bend inward in reverence, forming halls lit by bioluminescent fungi. Beneath it lies the **Rootvault**, a tangled labyrinth of memory trees and sealed altars‚Äîmost believe abandoned since the end of the Blooming War.

But something stirs beneath the roots now. Some say the gardens are growing wrong. That petals open at midnight, and the vines whisper in languages not heard since the Rising.

Bergav is beauty, blooming atop bones.
