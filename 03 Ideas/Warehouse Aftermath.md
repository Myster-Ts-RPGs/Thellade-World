## 🧷 City Hall — Scene & Tone

**Location**: Strategic Chamber, Mangagoy City Hall  
**Mood**: *Tense relief, overshadowed by dread and urgency*

- **Warden Draven**: Steely and reserved. “You struck a blow. But this ain’t over.”
- **Investigator Ralden Voss**: Frantic, cross-referencing ledgers. “There are names in here. Real ones.”
- **Brom Thunderbrew**: Mutters anxiously. “Cultists in our city. Burn it root to leaf.”
- **Sunwarden Zareth Korrath**: Furious and deeply concerned for Vaelis. “They desecrated Lunara’s light. This cannot stand.”
- **William & Theodore**: Proud but exhausted, defer to the party and Warden Draven.

## 🗣️ Interrogation: Borek “The Ox” Jundar

Captured and interrogated in the city barracks. He shares the following under pressure:

> “Drask? He wasn’t in charge. We answered to a noble. Black lion over a crescent. Kelthorne, maybe.”

- Says **the priestess was “The Vessel”**, meant to open a gate under the city during the Embermoon.
- Admits the crates weren’t just relics. Some pulsed. Some whispered.
- Names **House Kelthorne** as possible backers but is terrified of reprisals.
- Confirms the ledger is real and “meant for a buyer if Drask died.”

## 🏰 Using the Bleeding Tide Hideout as a Base

The city agrees to consider it IF the following conditions are met:

### Phase 1: Clearance (3–5 days)
- City Watch clears all contraband, wards off remaining dangers.

### Phase 2: Inspection
- **Dean Windspire** requires a written petition of use.
- **Mediator Valane** from the Eternal Concord inspects for planar contamination.

### Phase 3: Civic Task (Choose One)
- Track down the 5 named smugglers still in the city.
- Escort relics to the Concord Library (ambush risk).
- Protect Vaelis & Ralden during tribunal (threat of assassination).
- Recover a lost ledger page now in the marshlands.

### Phase 4: Sanctification & Deed Transfer
- **Sunwarden Zareth Korrath** sanctifies the structure.
- Property deeded to the party with limited oversight and civic status.
