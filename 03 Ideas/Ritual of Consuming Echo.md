## 🌑 Ritual of the Consuming Echo

**Performed by:** Maelthaz the Chained Seer  
**Victim:** Kaelor Thornhide  
**Location:** Beneath the ruins of a forgotten shrine to Lunara, near the fractured leyline node below Mangagoy’s lower catacombs  
**Date:** Unknown (Kaelor has no memory of the exact event—it was experienced during a memory blackout following contact with a Pre-Rising relic)

### ❖ **Purpose of the Ritual**

To anchor a mortal soul to the dream-echo of **Zorvithrax the Hungering Maw**, creating a living vessel through which the lieutenant may:

- Feed on mortal memory and emotion.
    
- Exert his will across the veil even while bound.
    
- Divert divine prophecy away from Lunara and toward the Abyss.
    

Kaelor was chosen not as a random victim, but because of **ancestral bloodline links to the original clerics who helped seal Zorvithrax** during the Rising. His divine resistance and lunar essence made him a perfect paradox—both threat and vessel.

### 🕯️ **Components of the Ritual**

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Dreamblight Candle**|A black flame candle of abyssal wax made from the souls of lost prophets. Emits no light—only shadow. Creates a shared mental space.|
|**Relic of Reflection**|A broken mirror from the original lunar temple where Kaelor first dreamed of the Maw. Used to draw out subconscious fear.|
|**Blood of the Remembered**|Stolen from the veins of a fellow Lunaran devotee, mixed with Kaelor’s own. Used to fuse memory with corruption.|
|**Name-Binding Sigil**|Written in Kaelor’s blood and abyssal ink. Carved into the earth and partially into the soles of Kaelor’s feet.|
|**Ash of the Unsealed**|Pulverized remains of a failed seal guardian, sprinkled across Kaelor’s chest during his sleep. Causes permanent susceptibility to dream-aligned possession.|

### 🧩 **Stages of the Ritual**

#### **Phase 1: The Drawing Inward**

- Kaelor was led to the ritual chamber while in a trance state caused by proximity to a sleeping relic.
    
- Maelthaz invoked **Zorvithrax’s true name** in the forgotten tongue of hunger, causing the leyline scar beneath the chamber to pulse.
    
- The **Dreamblight Candle** was lit, and all natural light in the chamber was snuffed out. Kaelor’s shadow separated from his body and whispered to him in his own voice.
    

#### **Phase 2: The Fracture of Memory**

- Maelthaz held the **Relic of Reflection** up to Kaelor’s eyes. His past memories twisted in the mirror: friends became enemies, loved ones faces became eyeless and hungry.
    
- The mirror cracked as Kaelor screamed—but the echo of his scream was trapped in a crystal shard and buried in the floor. This “echo” became the anchor point for Zorvithrax’s influence.
    
- **Corruption began to seep** into Kaelor’s dreams from that day forward, and visions of relics began to surface during long rests.
    

#### **Phase 3: The Name Unspoken**

- Maelthaz carved Zorvithrax’s sigil into the floor and traced it over Kaelor’s body in the **Blood of the Remembered**.
    
- He then whispered Kaelor’s true name—not the one he uses, but the one inscribed in the hidden tomes of Lunara’s shrine—**backward**, binding it to the Maw’s cycle of hunger.
    
- As he completed the utterance, Kaelor’s body convulsed, and the **Name-Binding Sigil** ignited in pale flame. It left no burn, only a mark visible in moonlight or mirrored water.
    

#### **Phase 4: The Mark of the Maw**

- With the **Ash of the Unsealed**, Maelthaz painted a final glyph over Kaelor’s heart: a spiraling maw devouring a crescent moon.
    
- As this glyph faded from visibility, it imprinted itself in Kaelor’s **soul-pattern**—granting Zorvithrax a direct link to him in dreamscapes and moments of emotional vulnerability.

### 💀 **Aftermath**

- Kaelor awoke alone and disoriented in the shrine, with no memory of the ritual—only dreams and whispers in the following weeks.
    
- Since then, he has been haunted by visions of relics, locations, and Zorvithrax’s growing hunger.
    
- The ritual has made Kaelor a **living echo-beacon**, drawing other cultists to him subconsciously and occasionally causing aberrant monsters to notice his presence.

### 🔒 **Reversing the Ritual (Rumored)**

To sever the link and break the curse:

- The **crystal shard** holding Kaelor’s scream must be shattered during an eclipse in a ley-scar.
    
- A mirror blessed by Lunara’s high clerics must reflect Kaelor’s true face while he speaks his **name in full**.
    
- Maelthaz must be silenced—permanently—so that no new anchors can be created.
    

Failing this, Kaelor will eventually be consumed: not in flesh, but as a dream construct swallowed by the Maw to be reborn as a harbinger.
