> [!summary]
> A repeating kill-and-cover ritual protocol used by agents of the Black Sepulcher to erase evidence of leyline manipulation and beacon tampering. Involves strategic relocation of binding beacons, destruction of courier routes, and assassination of witnesses.

---

### Overview

**Duskfall** is a classified operational protocol used by embedded cultist courier cells within the [[Black Sepulcher (Cult of Orcus)]]. When activated, it signals a multi-phase cover-up operation designed to eliminate all trace of leyline manipulation or beacon tampering, especially when civilians or unintended witnesses uncover elements of the cult's plan.

The phrase "Duskfall repeats" appears at the end of partially burned orders found on courier victims in [[Blackwater Crossing]], believed to refer either to:
- A specific **execution directive**
- A **cyclical operation pattern**
- Or a **ritual phrase** used to seal the intent of the act

---

### Protocol Objectives

- **Move the Beacon**: Relocate or invert a bound leyline node or Abyssal anchor to disrupt magical surveillance and reset ward alignment.
- **Burn the Route**: Destroy any physical trail used to transport the beacon, including waystations, couriers, and records.
- **Kill All Witnesses**: Eliminate known observers, typically by surprise attack, poison, or abyssal transformation.

### Signs of a Duskfall Activation

- Melted or charred [[Courier Guild]] pins found near the corpse (symbolically ‘burning the route’)
- Blackened footprints or ash patterns forming glyphs at the scene
- Parchment fragments containing variations of the phrase:  
  _"They saw too much—move the beacon, then burn the route. Duskfall repeats."_
- Residual necrotic residue near leyline channels or beacon foundations
- The presence of ephemeral bone-tethered familiars observing survivors (usually ignored if unnoticed)

### Notable Use

> **Blackwater Crossing Incident – Dawnmarch 212 PR**  
Three courier agents (Scraps, Rellik, and Vissra) were found dead under suspicious circumstances. All three were linked to subversive deliveries between Daggerfall Hollow and Duskwell Cavern. Pinned to one boot heel was a scorched note containing the now-infamous phrase “Duskfall repeats.”  
[[Campaign Group 1]] is currently being watched for indirect knowledge of this event.

### Related Entities

- **Sub-Faction Theory**: Some scholars suggest *Duskfall* is not merely a phrase, but a specialized courier-murder cell operating independently under the larger Cult of Orcus umbrella.
- **Whispers of “Duskwell”**: Recent leyline surge charts suggest a beacon was last anchored somewhere within the upper galleries near [[Duskwell Cavern]]—possibly the intended “move site.”

### Usage Note

Use of the phrase “Duskfall repeats” in written or magical communication may:
- Activate embedded sigils  
- Serve as a ritual keyword to authorize autonomous field actions  
- Mark a leyline node for post-operation collapse
