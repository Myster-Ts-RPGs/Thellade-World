# Time Magic of The Dark One

These spells, abilities, and feats are not taught—they are remembered. Echoes from dead worlds, whispered by entities that predate continuity itself. Only found through direct contact with minions of **The Dark One**, or uncovered in ruins from the **Time Wars Era**.

## Time-Based Spells (10)

These spells are renamed to reflect Thellade’s lore and should only be granted to NPCs, creatures, or (rarely) PCs touched by the influence of The Dark One. All are prepared spells and function under PF2e’s arcane spellcasting system.

### Cantrips

- **Chrono Step**  
  The caster briefly phases forward a moment in time, stepping 15 feet as a reaction when targeted by an attack. If this moves them out of range, the attack automatically fails.

### 2nd Level

- **Rewind Fate**  
  Allows the caster to reroll one failed saving throw, attack roll, or skill check they made within the last round.

- **Future Sight**  
  Grants the caster brief glimpses of nearby future branches. For 1 minute, gain +2 status bonus to Initiative and +1 to Perception checks. Cannot be surprised.

- **Time Dilation**  
  Target must succeed on a Fortitude save or become Slowed 1. On a critical failure, the target becomes Slowed 2 for 1 round.

### 3rd Level

- **Chrono Displacement**  
  Temporarily removes a creature from the timeline. The target vanishes and reappears in a random unoccupied space within 30 feet after 1 round. While vanished, they are immune to all effects.

### 4th Level

- **Temporal Echo**  
  Summons a translucent copy of the caster as they were in the previous round. The echo repeats the caster's most recent action (as GM determines).

- **Temporal Anchor**  
  Anchors a creature’s timeline. The creature cannot teleport, time travel, or be shifted between planes for 1 minute.

### 5th Level

- **Chrono Shift**  
  Choose one creature that completed its turn within the last round. That creature is returned to the state it was in at the start of its turn (position, HP, spell effects).

- **Aging Curse**  
  Imposes accelerated aging on the target. Each round, the target takes 1d6 damage per age category advanced and takes a –2 status penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based checks.

### 6th Level

- **Stasis Field**  
  Create a 20-foot-radius sphere of frozen time for 1 minute. All creatures inside are Paralyzed and Unaware of the passage of time. Area is immune to entry or effect from outside until the spell ends.

## Pathfinder 2e Feats (4) – Chrono Wizard Options

These feats allow limited access to time magic for rare PC builds who have made contact with time-ruined magic or agents of The Dark One.

### 1. Initiate of the Temporal Arts (Level 2)
You gain access to the **Chrono Step** spell as an additional cantrip. You gain a +1 status bonus to Initiative rolls. Chrono Step is always added to your spellbook and does not count against spells known.

### 2. Chrono Shield (Level 4)
**Reaction** – When you are hit by an attack, you may immediately surround yourself with a burst of suspended time, reducing the damage taken by an amount equal to twice your level. You must be able to cast spells and be unencumbered.

### 3. Time Step (Level 6)
**1 Action** – You briefly step out of phase. Until the start of your next turn, you cannot be targeted by reactions. Requires that you cast or prepare time-based spells.

### 4. Master of Moments (Level 8)
**1 Action** – Once per day, you accelerate your presence in the timeline. You may take an additional action this turn. This action must be different from your other three.

All of the above abilities are restricted to NPCs and creatures unless explicitly unlocked by narrative progression tied to remnants of the **Time Wars** or the whispering influence of **The Dark One**.
