# 🌐 Leyline Anchor Failure – The Ember Wharf
tags: #Idea #Magic #ZoneEffect #Mangagoy

## Overview
Following the events of the Embermoon Surge, one of the leyline anchors beneath [[The Ember Wharf]] catastrophically fails. This creates a zone of magical instability with persistent arcane flux, affecting all spellcasting and magical item usage within the district.

## 🔧 Ambient Trait: Unstable Ley Convergence
> “The leyline anchoring beneath The Ember Wharf has fractured. Magic flows unevenly, twisting intent and magnifying entropy.”

All spellcasting and activation of magical items within the district is affected by the following rules unless suppressed by ritual or ward.

## 🧩 Mechanical Rules (PF2e Remastered)

### 🎲 Leyline Flux Table (1d6, roll on each spellcast or magic item activation)

| d6 | Flux Effect |
|----|-------------|
| 1  | **Ley Backlash** – Caster takes 1d6 force damage per spell level (basic Fortitude save). |
| 2  | **Flicker** – Spell activates 1 round later (delayed trigger). |
| 3  | **Echo** – Spell repeats next round on same target (no cost). |
| 4  | **Amplify** – Spell gains +1 status bonus to Spell DC or spell attack roll. |
| 5  | **Refraction** – Targets are randomly reassigned among all valid within 30 ft. |
| 6  | **Stable Surge** – No adverse effect; spell functions normally. |

> *Note: Cantrips ignore this table unless part of a critical skill failure.*

### 🧪 Additional Effects by Spell School

- **Conjuration** – Teleportation effects require a DC 17 Arcana check or arrive 1d4×5 feet off target.
- **Evocation** – AoEs increase by +5 ft radius. Crit fail causes caster to take half spell level as splash damage.
- **Divination** – Scrying/Detect effects blocked indoors unless a focus component is used.
- **Necromancy** – Undead enter with **Frightened 1** for 1 round, but gain +1 status vs. divine saves.

## 🔒 Mitigation Options

- **Ward Sigil (Temporary Stabilizer)**  
  Crafting or Arcana DC 22; 10 minutes and 1 gp in materials  
  → Suppresses leyline flux table in a 20-ft radius for 1 hour (single caster)

- **Anchor Repair Ritual (Major Quest)**  
  A 3-part ritual requiring:
  - A divine relic of the binding order  
  - A reconstructed leyline schema fragment  
  - Cooperation from [[Temple of Aurion and Lunara]] & [[Ashen Vanguard]]

## Narrative Consequences
- Magical scholars, cultists, and planar agents may all begin investigating the district.
- Reliance on spellcasting becomes a liability in the area—shifting balance toward martial or divine problem-solving.
- The instability may worsen over time or spread unless addressed.
