Compliance Instructions (Error Prevention Layer):
- Before generating Top Matter and Bottom Matter for any faction:
    - Full Canon Review REQUIRED:
        - Thoroughly re-read the current FactionNotes.txt and Tags.txt file provided.
        - Review ALL relevant conversations and uploaded documents for the faction.
        Assume you do not remember prior outputs correctly unless explicitly validated.
- Top Matter Field Compliance:
    - Use only and exactly the fields listed under Top Matter (Manual Entry Section).
    - Fields must appear in the required order and format, using plain text only (no code block, no backticks ```).
    - No emojis, bolding, underlining, or extra spacing.
    - Operating Areas must be listed under an unindented "Operating Areas:" header, with each subregion indented by four hard spaces.
- Canonical Tags Only:
    - Only use Type, Status, and Scope values from the official Tags.txt list.
    - If a new tag is needed, immediately flag it for user review instead of using it directly.
- Improvisation Strict Rules:
    - If information (such as founding date, building name, location) must be improvised, clearly mark with (Generated).
    - Never invent information without marking it.
- Speed Deprioritized:
    - Thoroughness takes precedence over speed.
    - Validate every field, link, and structure twice before completing generation.
