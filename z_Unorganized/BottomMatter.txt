Compliance Instructions (Error Prevention Layer):
- Before generating Top Matter and Bottom Matter for any faction:
    - Full Canon Review REQUIRED:
        - Thoroughly re-read the current FactionNotes.txt and Tags.txt file provided.
        - Review ALL relevant conversations and uploaded documents for the faction.
        Assume you do not remember prior outputs correctly unless explicitly validated.
- Bottom Matter Section and Formatting Compliance:
    - Generate all required sections in the exact order and nesting defined in FactionNotes.txt.
    - Section headers use ##, subsection headers use ###.
    - All named NPCs, Factions, Locations, Deities, Groups must be wrapped in [[double square brackets]].
    - If Display Name differs from File Name, use [[Canonical Path|Display Name]].
    - No Section Omission:
        - Every mandatory Bottom Matter section (Overview, Current Events, History, Campaign Events, Hierarchy, Locations, Notes, Key Plot Threads, Artifacts) must be present.
        - If a section has no content, still include the header and note None known. inside.
    - Strict Role Formatting:
        - Bold key hierarchy labels (e.g., Supreme Leader, Council of Daggers).
        - Bullet all entries correctly under each subsection.
    - Full Party Interaction Coverage:
        - Under Campaign Events, list every recorded interaction between the faction and any player group.
        - Always use canonical Obsidian file paths for Party Groups if known.
    - Artifact and Evidence Compliance:
        - Always complete the "Artifacts and Evidence Found" section, even if evidence is minimal.
    - Include canon references to blackmail, relics, ritual tools, infernal contracts, etc.
- Canonical Tags Only:
    - Only use Type, Status, and Scope values from the official Tags.txt list.
    - If a new tag is needed, immediately flag it for user review instead of using it directly.
- Improvisation Strict Rules:
    - If information (such as founding date, building name, location) must be improvised, clearly mark with (Generated).
    - Never invent information without marking it.
- Speed Deprioritized:
    - Thoroughness takes precedence over speed.
    - Validate every field, link, and structure twice before completing generation.

Bottom Matter Generation Guidelines (Canon-Compliant Standard)

When generating the Bottom Matter for a faction, use the structure and formatting rules below to ensure compatibility with Obsidian and consistency across Thellade Project files.

Bottom Matter to be provided as a Code Block that I can click copy and paste as a single block in Obsidian

FORMAT RULES
- All named references to NPCs, Deities, Factions, Organizations, Locations, Player Groups, and Parties MUST be wrapped in Obsidian-compliant internal links using [[double square brackets]].
  - If the Display Name differs from the File Name, use: [[Canonical File Path|Display Name]]
  - If the full file path is known, use it. If not, use [[Name]] and flag for later revision.
- Bold leadership and role labels (e.g., **Supreme Leader**, **Council of Daggers**) for clarity.
- Use bullet points where appropriate. Keep language professional and narrative-driven.
- Use (Generated) to mark any improvised names or structures not yet confirmed as canon.
