I have uploaded the summary information for the requested faction. This information is about a month old. You are to throughly analyze this summary information as well all of the information in the Project Thellade (project files and all chats) to find all mentions of the faction so far. Once done you are to provide the infomation to me so that I can incorporate it into may master obsidian notes by following these specific directions.

For each organization provide the following (if any) (*Indicate Mandatory Items) 

If any mandatory item is not found in canon you may improvise, but mark as NONE. Do not omit. 

Optional fields may also use None if not found.

Operating Areas must be listed in the following fixed order: Jambito > Kanda > Lambaro > Mangagoy > Middle Isles > Mwingu. If the faction does not operate in the region write NONE. If it does operate in that subregion Use one of: (Settlement > District > Location Name) OR (Subregion > Location Name). If specific location is unknown but city is known, use: Settlement > District > [Improvised Name] (Generated); If building name is meant to be mysterious, write: Settlement > District > Unknown

If a tag is used that is not listed in Tags.txt, notify the user so it can be added or replaced.

Current Events needs to include any specific mentions of party interaction with the faction.

  
For each organization, provide the following fields (if any). Fields marked with * are **mandatory** and **must not be omitted**. If a mandatory field has no canonical data, you may improvise, but mark the value as `NONE`. Optional fields may also use `NONE` if not found.

All markdown formatting should be fully nested and indented where appropriate. ## headers for sections, ### for subsection labels (as shown). Use standard markdown bullets where needed.

  - If the Display Name differs from the File Name, use: [[Canonical File Path|Display Name]]
  - If the full file path is known, use it. If not, use [[Name]] and flag for later revision.
- Bold leadership and role labels (e.g., **Supreme Leader**, **Council of Daggers**) for clarity.
- Use bullet points where appropriate. Keep language professional and narrative-driven.
- Use (Generated) to mark any improvised names or structures not yet confirmed as canon.

Additional Canon Compliance Instructions (Error Prevention Layer)
Before generating Top Matter and Bottom Matter for any faction:

Full Canon Review REQUIRED:

Thoroughly re-read the current FactionNotes.txt and Tags.txt file provided.

Review ALL relevant conversations and uploaded documents for the faction.

Assume you do not remember prior outputs correctly unless explicitly validated.

Top Matter Field Compliance:

Use only and exactly the fields listed under Top Matter (Manual Entry Section).

Fields must appear in the required order and format, using plain text only (no code block).

No emojis, bolding, underlining, or extra spacing.

Operating Areas must be listed under an unindented "Operating Areas:" header, with each subregion indented by two spaces.

Canonical Tags Only:

Only use Type, Status, and Scope values from the official Tags.txt list.

If a new tag is needed, immediately flag it for user review instead of using it directly.

Improvisation Strict Rules:

If information (such as founding date, building name, location) must be improvised, clearly mark with (Generated).

Never invent information without marking it.

Bottom Matter Section and Formatting Compliance:

Generate all required sections in the exact order and nesting defined in FactionNotes.txt.

Section headers use ##, subsection headers use ###.

All named NPCs, Factions, Locations, Deities, Groups must be wrapped in [[double square brackets]].

If Display Name differs from File Name, use [[Canonical Path|Display Name]].

No Section Omission:

Every mandatory Bottom Matter section (Overview, Current Events, History, Campaign Events, Hierarchy, Locations, Notes, Key Plot Threads, Artifacts) must be present.

If a section has no content, still include the header and note None known. inside.

Strict Role Formatting:

Bold key hierarchy labels (e.g., Supreme Leader, Council of Daggers).

Bullet all entries correctly under each subsection.

Full Party Interaction Coverage:

Under Campaign Events, list every recorded interaction between the faction and any player group.

Always use canonical Obsidian file paths for Party Groups if known.

Artifact and Evidence Compliance:

Always complete the "Artifacts and Evidence Found" section, even if evidence is minimal.

Include canon references to blackmail, relics, ritual tools, infernal contracts, etc.

Speed Deprioritized:

Thoroughness takes precedence over speed.

Validate every field, link, and structure twice before completing generation.
