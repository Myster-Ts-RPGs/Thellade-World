I have uploaded the summary information for the requested faction. This information is about a month old. You are to throughly analyze this summary information as well all of the information in the Project Thellade (project files and all chats) to find all mentions of the faction so far. Once done you are to provide the infomation to me so that I can incorporate it into may master obsidian notes by following these specific directions.

For each organization provide the following (if any) (*Indicate Mandatory Items) 

If any mandatory item is not found in canon you may improvise, but mark as NONE. Do not omit. 

Optional fields may also use None if not found.

Operating Areas must be listed in the following fixed order: Jambito > Kanda > Lambaro > Mangagoy > Middle Isles > Mwingu. If the faction does not operate in the region write NONE. If it does operate in that subregion Use one of: (Settlement > District > Location Name) OR (Subregion > Location Name). If specific location is unknown but city is known, use: Settlement > District > [Improvised Name] (Generated); If building name is meant to be mysterious, write: Settlement > District > Unknown

If a tag is used that is not listed in Tags.txt, notify the user so it can be added or replaced.

Current Events needs to include any specific mentions of party interaction with the faction.

  
For each organization, provide the following fields (if any). Fields marked with * are **mandatory** and **must not be omitted**. If a mandatory field has no canonical data, you may improvise, but mark the value as `NONE`. Optional fields may also use `NONE` if not found.

Each faction entry must include the following markdown sections, using ### for subheadings. Format them as shown:
Bottom Matter to be provided as a Code Block that I can click copy and paste as a single block in Obsidian
All markdown formatting should be fully nested and indented where appropriate. ## headers for sections, ### for subsection labels (as shown). Use standard markdown bullets where needed.

All named references to NPCs, Locations, Deities, Organizations/Factions, Parties, and Groups must be wrapped in [[double square brackets]] to ensure Obsidian recognizes and links to their respective notes.
Use the format [[Canonical Note Title|Display Text]] when display names differ from the file name (e.g., [[Selvik Thorne|Archmage Thorne]]).
This rule applies to all sections of the markdown output including Current Events, Notes, History, and Overview. All NPC file names have been named without their titles.
