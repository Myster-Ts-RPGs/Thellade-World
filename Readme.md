# Thellade Campaign Vault

This repository contains the structured markdown and metadata vault for **Thellade**, a persistent and richly detailed homebrew world developed for simultaneous Pathfinder 2E Remastered and Dungeons & Dragons 5E (2024) campaigns. The system is fully integrated with **Obsidian.md**, using templating, Git versioning, and linked data views to ensure world coherence, continuity, and campaign-specific narrative tracking.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- The canonical source of world information for Thellade, including:
  - Regions, subregions, settlements, and districts
  - Factions, organizations, and secret societies
  - Deities, demigods, creatures, and unique entities
  - Player-driven campaign logs, session notes, and world events
- A structured, version-controlled markdown vault suitable for:
  - Obsidian-based campaign preparation
  - Cross-party continuity across multiple campaigns
  - Clean integration with Git and community feedback via pull requests or discussion threads

## Features

- Semantic versioning for world progression and release tracking
- Custom `Git Commit` automation with metadata capture, diff tracking, and commit-based changelogs
- Cross-linked data structures for easy navigation across factions, locations, and campaign history
- Fully Templater-compatible note generation (e.g., Git Commit entries, canonical factions, NPCs)

## Repository Structure

- `01 Campaign/`: All active and archived campaign content by group and session
- `02 Mechanics/`: Custom rules, spells, items, and PF2e/5E homebrew systems
- `03 Lore/`: Historical records, planar cosmology, and mythologies
- `04 Entities/`: Deities, demigods, legendary beings, NPCs
- `05 Factions/`: Structured markdown files for each organization, including secret factions
- `80 Versioning/`: Commit messages and structured VaultChangelog tracking

## Versioning

The vault uses a **four-level semantic versioning system**:

Example: `1.2.3.4`

- **Major**: Structural milestones or full expansion sets (e.g., all locations stubbed)
- **Minor**: Completion of a full data set (e.g., all POIs detailed)
- **Feature**: New content or narrative developments for a region or faction
- **Breakdown**: Micro changes, bug fixes, minor entries or single-session updates

Complete details of this system are found at [VersioningRules.md](VersioningRules.md)
