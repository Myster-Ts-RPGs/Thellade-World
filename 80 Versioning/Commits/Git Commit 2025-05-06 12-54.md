Version 1.1.0.4

## Summary
> Finalize Boba District Shops

## Description
> Completed integration of all shop-related POIs across Boba's districts. Verified coverage of all canonical ShopType entries, added missing shop categories (Bakery, Grocer, Scribe, Mail Service, Bookstore, Cartographer), and assigned each new shop a district, appropriate tags, and flavor descriptions. This finalizes the shop layer for Boba and prepares for further faction or NPC tie-ins.
