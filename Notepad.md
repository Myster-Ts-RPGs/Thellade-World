### Coming up
#### Aktia's Birthday

The [[Motley Few]]  is now back in [[Valdian]] and celebrating [[Aktia Trevenor]]'s Birthday.

#### Goblin's in the Feldon Forest

The [[Motley Few]] may go see [[Bekkar Tullet]] on the [[Odinys Small Council]] to potentially get paid for the Goblin Threat at [[Feldon]].

The [[Motley Few]] will be heading to [[Feldon]] to potentially deal with the goblin threat.

The [[Motley Few]] will be heading to [[Feldon]] to potentially make it a home.

[[Kord Constructions]] is helping construct a hasty palisade wall to help defend the settlement.

[[Nalverig Oa'Crest]] & [[Marselle Ervax]] from the [[Exomancers]] ([[Phoenix Consort]]) are in the area hunting down the goblin threat.

The goblins aren't going to attack [[Feldon]] for some time. The goblins are going to be deep in the forest and setting up their own camps and getting acclimated to the forest.


### Down the line
#### King's Death

Leading up to harvest festival (26th Messis) the [[Vinkus Dunhall]] will die.

The kingdom of [[Odinys]] will mourn and the harvest festival will be one of the largest the kingdom has ever seen.

During the Festival, if the [[Motley Few]] decided to follow [[Roland Briarfell]] & [[Ayda Syrel]] to [[Valdian]] to celebrate the festival, they will have the opportunity to join in the coliseum fight and gain some money.

After the fighting pits, the last fight will be [[Lucious Dunhall]] and a famous night who wants the honour of defeating the prince. However, [[Roland Briarfell]] will step up and announce he is the bastard son of [[Vinkus Dunhall]] and is called [[Roland Briarfell|Roland Dunhall]]. Unless the party intervenes, he will win the fight and become king.


#### Lycanthrope Curse

[[Wyn Syrel]]'s Lycanthrope curse becomes too strong for her necklace that is dampening it. Whilst they are having their downtime in [[Feldon]], [[Wyn Syrel]] unknowingly turns into her Werebear form and murder a villager. The [[Motley Few]] they must work out the murder mystery which will point back to [[Wyn Syrel]].  

This should then lead [[Wyn Syrel]] into wanting to head back to the Dynasty, back to the Sylvant Circle Druids to find a permanent solution.

### Future
#### A New Rebellion

When [[Roland Briarfell|Roland Dunhall]] takes over the throne, there will be some time of peace, but layered with tension and uncertainty. In the background, the [[Odinys Rebellion]] will be plotting and making their final preparations to unite the realm against the crown. Erupting into another civil war.
